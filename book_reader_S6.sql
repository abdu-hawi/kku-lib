Diamant brings her remarkable storytelling skills to \"Good Harbor\" -- offering insight to the precarious balance of marriage and career, motherhood and friendship in the world of modern women. The seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts is a place where the smell of the ocean lingers in the air and the rocky coast glistens in the Atlantic sunshine. When longtime Gloucester-resident Kathleen Levine is diagnosed with breast cancer, her life is thrown into turmoil. Frightened and burdened by secrets, she meets Joyce Tabachnik -- a freelance writer with literary aspirations -- and a once-in-a-lifetime friendship is born. Joyce has just bought a small house in Gloucester, where she hopes to write as well as vacation with her family. Like Kathleen, Joyce is at a fragile place in her life.\nA mutual love for books, humor, and the beauty of the natural world brings the two women together. They share their personal histories, and help each other to confront scars left by old emotional wounds.\nWith her own trademark wisdom and humor, Diamant considers the nature, strength, and necessity of adult female friendship. \"Good Harbor\" examines the tragedy of loss, the insidious nature of family secrets, as well as the redemptive power of friendship.'),

To make matters worse, her favorite uncle is living in a car. Her Nonny cries every time her father\'s name is mentioned. And the two sides of her family aren\'t speaking to each other!\nInspired by Newbery Honor winner Jennifer Holm\'s own Italian American family, Penny from Heaven is a shining story about the everyday and the extraordinary, about a time in America\'s history, not all that long ago, when being Italian meant that you were the enemy. But most of all, it\'s a story about families--about the things that tear them apart and bring them together. And Holm tells it with all the richness and the layers, the love and the laughter of a Sunday dinner at Nonny\'s. So pull up a chair and enjoy the feast! Buon appetito!'),

I know that more than most. Everything good I\'ve ever had has been stolen from me -- my friends, my fiance, my innocence, some would say even my sanity. All I have left is the cage. Fighting is the only thing that eases the ache inside me even a little. It\'s the only thing that keeps the bottle at bay.\nI was content to ride out my life alone. I was done dreaming that things could be better. But then I met Grace, and from that moment, all I could do was dream.\nShe\'s battling those same demons, only she\'s losing. I don\'t want to care, but something about her calls to me. That pain in her eyes is so sharp, so familiar. I know it\'s only a matter of time before it pulls her below the surface.\nI can help her, and maybe, just maybe, she can help me too. For the first time in what feels like forever, I\'ve got hope, and that scares the hell out of me.\nThis book is told from dual perspectives, so both Grace and Logan get their say. It is a full length (300 page) novel with no cliffhanger. There is likely to be a sequel, but the story can be enjoyed alone.\nNot suitable for younger readers. This is an intense story that deals with issues of alcoholism and military PTSD, and it contains adult content.'),

After gaining admission to Oxford, and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs, then marriage and family, Mead read and reread Middlemarch. The novel, which Virginia Woolf famously described as \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people,\" offered Mead something that modern life and literature did not.\nIn this wise and revealing work of biography, reporting, and memoir, Rebecca Mead leads us into the life that the book made for her, as well as the many lives the novel has led since it was written.

Calvary is a beautiful place, with no crime, no drama and nestled along the great lakes. It is surrounded in lush forests, quiet, safe, everything you could ever wish for...or is it?\nAs Rue approaches her 17th birthday she is plagued with one problem, a very big one. Her Mother, Grace, has fallen ill. It is not a disease that can easily be fixed with medication, it is one of the mind. Grace has been admitted to Rolling River Asylum and once she is gone, Rue\'s perfect world starts to crumble around her. Everything she has known is suddenly taken from her and with it her feeling of safety is dissolved.\nDesperate to pull Rue out of her depression, her brother talks her into going to a party at the Graph house, home to Johnathan Graph, a boy Rue has always felt a strong connection to, but never acted on it. Once she is at the party she reconnects with Johnathan and is shocked at how her feelings seem to be so strong for him, but with one touch Rue has a terrifying vision and it sets everything into motion.\nSoon after her revelation at the party, Grace and William suddenly disappear and with their absence two strangers, that of Joshua and Samantha Barrington, enter into Rue\'s life. They come as protectors, not only to her, but to everyone she loves. Without them she would be lost, but with them she is reminded of how much she does not know. There is a war coming, a war that threatens everything she loves, everything she knows or ever will know. She is forced to face the truth about herself and about her family\'s history, a truth that stems back to the beginning of time and that of the vampire.\nRewrite history through the eyes of the immortal.'),

But it isn\'t the monster Conor\'s been expecting-- he\'s been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he\'s had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It\'s ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd-- whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself-- Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.'),

Born in the 1960s and raised with traditional values in Robinson, Illinois, Bensie desperately wanted romance, a beautiful wedding, and a baby to carry on the family name. He denied his sexuality and married a woman at nineteen years old, but fantasized of weddings where he could be the bride. The newlyweds \"adopted\" a Cabbage Patch Doll and ironically witnessed a Cabbage Patch Doll wedding (a successful fundraiser staged by a local women\'s club) where the dolls were granted the type of grand ceremony off-limits to gay couples. In search of his identity as a gay man, Bensie divorced his wife and stumbled through missteps and lessons that still sting his generation: defending against bullies, \"disappointing\" his parents, and looking for love in gay bars, bath houses and restrooms. He helped his straight friends plan their dream weddings and mourned his gay friends dying of AIDS. Although true love has not yet come his way, Bensie has learned to love himself. Bensie is the author of the much-lauded memoir, Shorn: Toys to Men, which recounts his battle with paraphilia. One Gay American tells the rest of his story and draws parallels to gay history, decade by decade, with newspaper headlines and quotations. Bensie is the gay neighbor that you either love or hate. Either way, he\'s got a lot to say and says it with no apologies.'),

(1, 1, 97, 5, 'This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. \n It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I\'ve read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being \"reactionaries\", etc. \n It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. (view spoiler)[Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. \n But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. \n I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they\'ve gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don\'t get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. \n I loved this quote: \n \"In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....\" \n (hide spoiler)]'),

(3, 1, 30, 3, 'A fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. I read it in 2 nights and couldn\'t put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: \n \"I think about all the choices we\'ve made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don\'t know...\" \"What?\" \"So fragile.\" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, \"It\'s terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.\" \n (view spoiler)[This book can\'t be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I\'m being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I\'d still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. \n If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can\'t be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. \n \"Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice.\" Daniela says, \"Life doesn\'t work that way. You live with your choices and learn. You don\'t cheat the system.\" \n (hide spoiler)]'),
(4, 1, 7, 4, 'I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off 1 star - but overall a wow book. \n It\'s the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people. \n The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can\'t be recreated. \n But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It\'s observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this: \n \"Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase \"it is as if\". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human. Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognition--the tell, as they say, meaning the thing that tells, the giveaway. In the infinite black space of ignorance, it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition, the mark perhaps of consciousness itself. Human language: it is as if it made sense.\" \n Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers, trying to match things we\'ve seen before to new things, and if they don\'t match perfectly, it doesn\'t matter, because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information. But this is incredibly fuzzy! The AI also makes hilarious observations like this: \n Indeed, it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from 100 percent. Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme, or show alliteration or the like. What goes around comes around: really? What does this mean?\" \n Or this, as it analyzes chatter from Earth: \"It was a whiny culture, we were finding.\" \n Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind. I especially loved it\'s discussion of the meaning of life - it really nails it. If a program (or a person) has no objective, it has no purpose, no meaning, no organizing principle, and it\'s existence will be in trouble. But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts & actions - or your subroutines - than you have a purpose. Meaning is the hard problem indeed. \n \"We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labor of love. It absorbed all our operations entirely. It gave a meaning to our existence. And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell. But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble, very deep trouble, for at that point there is no organizing principle, no end to the halting problems, no reason to live, no love to be found. No: meaning is the hard problem.\" \n (view spoiler)[My review focuses a lot on the AI, but that\'s not the main thrust of the book. The war between stayers and leavers, the political tensions, the slinghot maneuvers to get back - all make the book worth reading. And as a surfer, I love how it ends with Freya finding meaning in surfing waves. (hide spoiler)]'),
(5, 1, 23, 4, 'A beautiful story. It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn\'t sure if I\'d like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. \n That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. \n I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn\'t tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn\'t see, so he didn\'t leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don\'t be paralyzed by your fears. \n This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.\"'),

(7, 1, 39, 4, 'Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson. I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit). \n One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn\'t conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America\'s attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America\'s troops to arrive. \n \"the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war.\" \n Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance: \n \"In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path.\" \n Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn\'t get more supplies. \n There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well. Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households, straw hat day. \n My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details - about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock - and stuff like that - felt a bit padded in that respect. But overall, a great read.'),

The great thing about a good Stephenson book is it makes you think about the future in new ways, and this book was no exception. \n It was really two books, and I certainly didn\'t see the second one coming. It starts out in modern times and then someone blows up the moon. We don\'t have time to find out who, as within a few years the fragments of the moon cause the worst asteriod shower earth has ever seen and wipe out all life in earth. We have time to send 1,500 people up into space - and this is their story. \n The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me. Stephenson has clearly looked 10-20 years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go. From robot workers in space, nano-bots, nano-robot weapons, and more - we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives. \n I thought the focus on use of whip technology in space was interesting. And of course, the whole notion of Cradle was just cool - though not sure about it\'s feasibility.'),
(9, 2, 2, 5, 'I couldn\'t put this book down. It was well written - even elegant in a way, as well as though provoking. I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvas\'s for humanity, and what matters. In Station Eleven an Ebola-esque virus (the Georgia Flu) knocks out over 99% of the worlds population. This story is told half right before the collapse, and half afterwards, and has several threads that tie together nicely. \n Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating. One by one, cable tv, the internet, water, and power all eventually stop working. Nobody is alive to maintain them - or who even knows how. Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes, groceries, guns, and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities. Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge, and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall. We really know nothing individually - our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions. \n If there is a motto of the book, it\'s probably this quote: \"Because survival is insufficient\". Humanity craves for more than survival - we crave for something more out of life. The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare, and bring some art and a shared experience. Interesting that of all the artists from the past 400 years, Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates. \n \"All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such, THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides, but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient.\" \n \"Survival might be insufficient, she\'d told Dieter in late-night arguments, but on the other hand, so was Shakespeare.\" \n The storyline pre-collapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting. I won\'t say much about it, other than Arthur, his wives, and the paparazzi-turned-jounalist-turned-paramedic-turned-doctor Jeevan, seem to all be searching for meaning in their lives. And ironically Jeevan seems to find the most, becoming a doctor after the collapse. Also, I\'m glad I\'m not a Hollywood celebrity. The conversation between Arthur and Jeevan where Arthur just wants to talk about anything but himself stuck with me - sometimes we are all sick of talking about ourselves. \n Regardless of what you think about this book, one thing is for sure - after you put it down and walk around the world, you are full of a newfound appreciation and gratitude for everything. Hopefully that appreciation and gratitude will stick around a little - though I know it will fade as months and years go by. \n ps. This is cool:'),
(10, 2, 36, 4, 'What a fun series. I loved Wool, and Dust and Shift both gave us the backstory to explain the world and how it ended up. I think the first book was by far the best, but this gave us a nice conclusion. \n (view spoiler)[It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I\'m not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great. \n There were lots of things that weren\'t cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn\'t clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn\'t the world really be a wasteland? \n Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo\'s that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later. \n What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn\'t it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own? \n The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn\'t rot was never really explained. I\'m guessing they were kept whole by healing nano\'s, but it felt like there was more to that story. \n I didn\'t understand why Anna didn\'t come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one. (hide spoiler)] \n If anything, I think this book is about hope and resiliency. Jules and Donald and even Solo weren\'t perfect, and suffered through a lot, but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life, and determination to keep themselves alive. That determination defined them and was what we admired about them. The hope was what gave them their drive. Hope is a powerful and necessary part of human psychology.'),
(11, 3, 61, 5, 'Mark Watney is a steely-eyed missile man. A man\'s man. A badass mechanical engineer botanist astronaut who is stranded on Mars during a Nasa mission gone wrong, and left to fend for himself. I listened to this on audio on a roadtrip, and it flew by - what a fun story. Not surprised at all it\'s being made into a movie directed by Ridley Scott starring Matt Damon. Also pretty amazing is that it was self-published. \n There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science. The science appealed to the mechanical engineer in me - Watney is a bit like McGyver except he knows a lot more about chemistry and botany. I didn\'t double-check all the science, but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations, creating water, etc. Just fun stuff. \n But the humor was top notch. Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries. And the excellent audio narrator only made it better. \n \"I started the day with some nothin\' tea. Nothin\' tea is easy to make. First, get some hot water, then add nothin\'.\" \n \"Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.\" \n \"Live Another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie.\" \n In the end, a well told story of survival against the odds. And one of belief - I liked the CNN Mark Watney watch - you could totally imagine how into this story the media would get. We humans love a good surviving against the odds story.'),
(12, 3, 44, 4, 'An amazing and unique creation: JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst created what reads like a classic work of fiction - something you can easily imagine having read in English class - and then wrote a intriguing side story in the margins. A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. \n The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I\'m reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. \n The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it\'s a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like \"relationships\" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. \n One thing I didn\'t realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it\'s an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It\'s a ship that can\'t die. Or a series of ships :) \n I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story. They were real characters that you could relate to. SOT felt like books you read in english class - a bit obtuse - and I still don\'t understand it all. But don\'t get me wrong - it\'s a pretty cool story. I particularly enjoyed the themes - like how it all begins and ends with water, and also how it was a lot about Straka\'s regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love. Kind of like how S was on a mission, but didn\'t really know why - he just found himself caught up in it.'),
(13, 3, 21, 5, 'I tore through The Pillars of the Earth, and couldn\'t wait to pick this up. Set in Kingsbridge but a few centuries later, the story has a lot of similar elements: a cathedral that needs repair, a brilliant young builder (Merthin), a love story, a priorship up for grabs, and of course political manuevering, backstabbing and evil church officials. Also like the first one, the characters were developed well, the book was hard to put down, and yet it wasn\'t a deep book, just a fun one. Thank goodness I finished - it was causing me to lose sleep. \n I did enjoy learning about the plague, and medieval ideas on health and medicine. Amazing that the plague wiped about a third of the human population, and how little they knew about it. Was frustrated by the lack of the Monks openness to learn new things, and how little they trusted women. For instance they believed in bleeding as a solution to everything when it actually is harmful in most cases. Also was interesting that there was no such thing as a doctor - instead nuns/monks/etc served that role.'),

I\'m glad she finally convinced me, because it was fun and I couldn\'t put it down after I got ~20% in. \n Bernadette moved to Seattle from LA, abandons her career as an architect to have kids, hates Seattle, and basically loses it over the course of the book. The book was fun and written a light, humorous tone - from making fun of Seattle and Microsoft, the obsession of parents and how serious they take themselves (I loved how she called the other parents \"gnats\"), to how she hires a virtual assistant in India. \n But the most fun part of the book is just how wacky Bernadette is. You really do have to make life fun - it won\'t do it for you. \n \"That\'s right,\' she told the girls. \'You are bored. And I\'m going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it\'s boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it\'s on you to make life interesting, the better off you\'ll be.\"'),
(15, 4, 78, 4, 'A fun fast paced book that sucks you in right away and doesn\'t let go. The remnants of humanity live in a 150 story silo below the earth and can\'t leave as the outside is now toxic. This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened, but it gives us a nice palette to think about things. \n Everything is rationed, including how many children you can have. People self-identify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers, IT in the mids, and professional class in the uppers. The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them. \n The book was a lot about control. How to control a contained civilization, and give them hope (eg a live feed of the outside) and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions. Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have - many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send. Most strange of all - there is no elevator, which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend 2-3 days on the journey. \n The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture. (view spoiler)[Upon reflection, I can see why it was necessary. If people never go outside, uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in, and people would need to try it. As perhaps happened in Silo 17. (hide spoiler)] \n I really liked the unraveling of Bernard, and how he went from repulsive/annoying, to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility. (view spoiler)[His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo. Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately. (hide spoiler)] \n I liked Juliet too - she was the right combo of being determined to do right, and having brains and grit.'),
(16, 4, 93, 4, 'A hilarious romp through the known and unknown universe that exposes how ridiculous much of US copyright law is. Written by the founder of Rhapsody, who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it. What I didn\'t expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn\'t work for me. \n The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity. \n It\'s pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for, and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate. \n Overall a fun, enjoyable read.'),

It\'s about a hacker during the Arab Spring, helping people get around the firewalls that the State erected to control its population. Alif falls in love, finds an ancient book, gets into trouble with State, enlists the help of an unseen, magical world full of creatures call Jinn, and combats evil. The story flowed well, and was a fast, fun read. \n I would have given it a higher rating, but I\'m a computer programmer, and for a book that is about hacking the descriptions of Alif coding felt like I was watching one of those movies where they used a bunch of made-up visuals that have nothing to do with hacking. The prose around the hacking was so oddly descriptive you didn\'t know what to make of it. For instance, when Alif is hacking into State\'s intranet, it is described as: \n \"The Hand roused. It lumbered to its feet, reeking of ionized air and dry metallic bones, revealing a level of functionality Alif had not detected. He reeled backward, recalibrating. Breaching the confines of the State intranet, the Hand began to attack the base of Alif\'s tower, slicing away layers of code through a mirroring protocol of a kind Alif had never seen before.\" \n I didn\'t know a computer program could \"reek of ionized air\" - and can\'t conceive of how a mirroring protocol (if there is such a thing) could ever be used to \"slice away layers of code\". \n (view spoiler)[I wanted so hard for the bit about quantum computing and encoding the ancient story into code to make sense.

Going into the mind of a killer is a strange experience - I\'m not sure I totally enjoyed it. But what I did really enjoy was the authors writing; it was clean, fun, and even poetic - which made this book a quick enjoyable read. \n I loved all the introspective one-liners that Eli kept throwing out. For instance: \n \"but I could not sleep without proper covering and spent the rest of the night rewriting lost arguments from my past, altering history so that I emerged victorious.\" \n \"I thought, When a man is properly drunk it is as though he is an a room by himself--there is a physical, impenetrable separation between him and his fellows.\" \n Here is another miserable mental image I will have to catalog and make room for.\" \n \"It is true, I thought. I am living a life.\" \n \"The effects of her words stung me, and after she stole away I stood a long while before her looking glass, studying my profile, the line I cut in this world of men and ladies.\" \n I struggled however to find the point of this novel. What lesson was I meant to take away? What did we learn from Charlie and Eli\'s adventure? I suppose if anything the theme of the book was transformation. (view spoiler)[We witnessed Warm, Morris, and Eli have the courage to transform themselves and change their lives. In other words - it\'s easy to let life dictate your path. Eli\'s story of how Charlie sucked him into a life of crime was fascinating. Warm had a similar story of how he became a thief. We didn\'t learn about Morris\'s past, but we did see the difficulty of his decision to leave the Commodore\'s employment.

(19, 4, 15, 5, 'Wow. Amazing story, and well told - kept me up late at night! Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back - and it\'s inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination. It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war. \n One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war. I think there was some stat about how 5/6 of the US airmen that died did so from accidents - that is simply staggering. \n I love WWII stories, but most of the ones I\'ve seen and read have focused on Germany, so I really didn\'t know much about how Japan had treated their POW\'s. It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POW\'s. And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW\'s as slaves. \n One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW\'s being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven\'t all been POW\'s, we can relate to that basic need.'),

(22, 5, 75, 4, 'Great story of the US Ambassador to Germany and his experience during the build-up of ww2 from 1933 - 1937. Nothing new or exciting really revealed, and I\'m sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww2 out there, but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador, Dodd, and his daughter, Martha. The story was engaging and well-written, and thus interesting. I think the ending fell pretty flat - I was hoping for more. \n Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities, and this book did provide some clues. Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear, even if it wasn\'t the truth - and he was a great storyteller. He also used fear as a primary weapon, as there were many in Germany not behind him - but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up. \n I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives, where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents, clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation. He ruthlessly murdered an estimated 77 to several hundred people (the count was never really known) and played it off as putting down a rebellion, which much of the world bought for many years. \n I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd (and Martha) go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany, to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown. It was a slow gradual process, and one that I\'m sure was not immediately obvious to anyone. In the end, I think the book is aptly named.'),
(23, 5, 91, 4, '** spoiler alert ** \n An interesting book in terms of it\'s structure: 5 distinct stories that cascade into each other in subtle ways, then wind back out. This way of doing the structure was unique, and certainly very cool to see the subtle way they were tied together. But in the end it was kind of gimmick and probably not necessary. \n I generally don\'t try to summarize novels in my reviews, but in this case there was so much going on that the exercise was helpful. \n Story 1: The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing. Later revealed to be a journal in other stories. A story about a rather weak-willed protagonist, who is constantly taken advantage of by others (the ships captain, Dr Goose). Interesting side story about the peaceful native Moriori tribe and how they were taken advantage of. \n Story 2: Robert Frobisher. Perhaps my favorite story - about a penniless young musician who as a last-ditch attempt apprentices himself to an old master musician, Vyvyan Ayrs. The story is told through letters to a friend, Sixsmith, who appears in the next story. The story is about how Frobisher, the apprentice, goes from being overjoyed to have a job to being resentful that the master is using him and stealing his stuff. Robert sleeps with VA\'s wife the whole story, but ends up falling in love with the daughter in a cruel twist of fate. \n Story 3: Luisa Rey. Modern age story about a young journalist hot on the heels of a big scandal involving an energy company. Sixsmith is an engineer who leaks the story to her, and also has the letters from story #2. Classic detective-esque story, with lots of people willing to kill to protect their secrets and power. \n Story 4: Timothy Cavendish. Modern age story about a book editor who gets a smash hit, then the author\'s mafia-esque family get\'s on his case and he\'s on the run. He lands in a old-persons home/prison. This story is kind of a nightmare, and is revealed to be a movie in the next story. \n Story 5: Somni 451. One of favorites, for how different it was. Set in the far future in an asian country, humans have genetically created clones that serve as slaves. This lower class is regarded as unintelligent and controlled with drugs - but our protagonist, Somni, breaks through and becomes self-conscious. The scary thing is I can easily see this happening! Told as recollections in an interview. \n Story 6: Sloosha\'s Crossin\'. Story of Zach\'ry and Meronym in post apocalyptic Hawaii. Somni is now their deity. Story of the Valleysmen people and their struggle for freedom against neighboring tribes. \n All six stories were very graphic and real, and had extremely good character development. Mitchel could with a single sentence describe someone that you understood in a way I can\'t describe here. \n I wish the stories had more themes in common so I could say what I learned from this book. Though I suppose if I had to put my finger on it, the major theme was freedom and slavery. Ewing was under the control of Dr Goose and the ship captain, Frobisher became an unwilling servant to Arys, Luisa Rey needed to find the truth in order to free herself from the corporate villians, Frobisher was a prisoner bent on escape in a nursing home, Somni was literally a slave in her society and focused on freedom, and Zach\'ry\'s people were captured and enslaved. All the stories touched on various ways people can \"enslave\" and control other people for various reasons. \n I suppose the point is human beings are all greedy and will try to control other human beings, but if we are strong we can survive and find a way to free ourselves. Sounds good anyways, so I\'ll stick with that - but am interested to hear what other people thought.'),

It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other? I was expecting it because I\'ve seen Battle Royale, but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state. \n I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there. \n All in all, a fun read, but I feel kind of dirty for having read it.'),

But the end of the book just fell really flat. The villian was predictable, and we learned nothing about this ancient wisdom. \n I also have to say that I almost fell out of bed laughing with Dan Brown plugged Twitter at the end of the book. To be fair, he\'s right - people are excited about Twitter because it (along with many other websites) is helping cause a shift in our society. But I can\'t help wondering if 5 years from now, when Twitter is MySpace, people will read that and think \"wtf?\".'),

The way Flemming wrote, Bond seems much more human and susceptible, yet determined and focused him - in the movies he seems more superhuman. I think Daniel Craig\'s movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit. \n In any event I greatly enjoyed the duel between Scaramanga and Bond.'),

Kind of reminded me of Sherlock Holmes - another favorite of mine. \n Examining robots also gave a canvas for defining what it is to be human. I loved the robot religion story. Robots with a superiority complexes - but thank goodness for that first law or it would be a Terminator-style story. \n According to Asimov\'s predictions, in 2009 the robot revolution should be in full swing.

(32, 6, 54, 4, 'A great book and worth the read, but like many Gladwellian books, it can be summed up easily. The basic point is that there is no such thing as a true outlier. Success, it seems, is due primarily to hard work and circumstance - brains play little part. \n Gladwell went through several (fascinating) examples proving his thesis - people such as Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, some failed genius named Chris Langan. All of them had two things in common: they spent over 10,000 hours doing what they did, and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else. Bill Gates was smart, but so were lots of other geeks. He had the advantage of being 16 when the computing age came about, and being possibly the only 16 year old in the country with access to a computer - and he spent all his time on it. By the time he hit college he had well over 10,000 hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country. \n One of my favorite bits was the music study on page 39 that compared musicians, and \"couldn\'t find any \'naturals\'\" - the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal. It\'s kind of validating to hear this, as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us. But apparently this isn\'t true - and I think my personal experience agrees with this. The harder you work, the better you can do. \n One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things. The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant. Basically kids that are in the older third of their class (or hockey league) have a natural advantage when they\'re really little. They are the kids who make all-star, and get extra coaching, and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older. I was held back in pre-school so I was one of the oldest in my class, and I definitely think it helped me. Hmmm now can I plan my kids to be born to be the oldest?'),

I was almost put off when I saw it was a story about rabbits, originally written as a tale by a father to his children - but I\'m glad I wasn\'t. \n I found the folk tales about El-ahrairah to be very impressive. The author clearly had a vivid imagination to create so much of the rabbits culture and history.

I was kind of worried the plot wasn\'t going anywhere for much of it, but the writing was really good and drew me in. \n For much of the book I thought the main character (Richard) was too weak of a character for me to like much, but I liked how he grew in confidence towards the end. I think anytime one undertake\'s an adventure or a journey like that you grow so much. You have to get out there and fail a few times to have the confidence to know how to succeed! \n I also have to say I loved Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar.

(39, 6, 47, 4, '** spoiler alert ** \n I absolutely loved the first book, but didn\'t think the series finished as strong as I would have liked. \n Too many plot holes and things that didn\'t make sense. Maybe it was because it\'s supposed to be a children\'s book, but I didn\'t like things like how the harpies were so easily convince to change sides, how God\'s #2 is easily tricked by a little flirting, how Lyra & Will can suddenly easily lose their Daemons, and how two kids making love can save the universe. \n On the other hand the book did make you think, and I suppose religious ideas are probably best challenged in a children\'s book :) I did like the Dante\'s Inferno-esque description of the world of the dead, and Pullman\'s description of angels and their roles was brilliant. Also, the descriptions of how things evolved differently in different worlds was very interesting - particularly the Mulefa\'s world and the descriptions of the Gallivespians. I\'m usually not a tragedy fan, but I did think Lyra & Will being separated at the end was a romantic and appropriate ending.'),

I think all Americans need to read this book, as it helps to understand and sympathize with what the people in Afghanistan have gone through. Particularly interesting as the book spans 30+ years and paints a very graphic picture of how Afghanistan changed in that time. From Russian communists to warlords to the Taliban to US Army, there have been no shortage of invaders and wars, and victims. Khaled leaves out little of the misery and death, but also focuses on how life invariably always finds a way. \n So a little sad, but I liked it. I think the thing I liked most was that I\'ve read so few books about that area of the world, and now I feel like I\'ve gotten to know it, just a tiny bit.'),

(44, 7, 11, 5, 'I really enjoyed this book. The concept of a man who had grown up on Mars and never seen another human until he was in his twenties is such a fun idea - and a rich canvas. Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults - and our advantages. \n I think my favorite part of this book is the word \'grok\'. I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word - but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is \'to be enlightened about something\'. If you grok God you have reached enlightenment. If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it. If you grok another person you love them. If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming - that, and you\'re also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like \'grok\' :) I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasn\'t forgiven me, since I had to explain that it was \"a Martian word\"! \n One thing that I grokked (yes I\'m going to keep using it dammit) after finishing this book is that it is kind of a 60\'s manifesto for free love. I wasn\'t alive in the 60\'s, but given everything I know about the 60\'s from movies, books, etc it seemed that my grokking was right.'),

In the book you can only vote if you have gone through and graduated from military training. This prevents the uneducated and uncommitted citizens from voting.

(50, 8, 53, 5, 'I haven\'t read a good spy novel in a while - and this was a great one. Truly well written, and an amazing story given how short the book is. I tore through it in one day! \n It really dove into what it\'s like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what\'s best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time \"coming in from the cold\" - as did Laemas. \n The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That\'s impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one. \n The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas\' love interest)\'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all. It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied.'),

I really enjoyed the authors ability to bring these crazy characters to life, and explain the story behind how each one\'s quirks strange behavior. The book started out really strong, stagnated a bit for me 2/3 of the way in, but I loved the ending. \n I also thought the inclusion of magical elements throughout the story was an interesting and fun twist.

(56, 8, 61, 5, 'This book was a pure delight. The subtitle \"Adventures of a Curious Character\" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories. \n One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :) \n I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education. \n Another lesson learned from Feynman\'s studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. \n I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read.'),

This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. \n - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into \"conversational harmony\" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan. \n Stickyness Factor \n - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn\'t hold attention until each show \n was good. \n - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. \n - make the message personal to make it memorable \n The Power of Context \n - Broken window theory.

This book is geek-heaven: cryptography, world war II, code-breaking, nazi gold, and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story. \n It also was largely lost on me, and I suspect many of my generation, that the second world war was won - or at least greatly accelerated - in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes. Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. \n I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn\'t (not very productive). \n The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don\'t have to worry about that stuff, but it\'s a good reminder to think about, as we don\'t have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy\'s paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years.

One of the best-second chance romances I\'ve ever read. \n Kennedy and Johnny fell in love when they were just in high school. Johnny was a naturally-gifted actor and left his family behind to follow his dreams of becoming an actor. Kennedy ran away with him to Hollywood when she was just 17, giving up her dreams to follow his. Real life brutally intruded, and Kennedy left Johnny after he got his first big break. He quickly got lost in the throes of addiction and the Hollywood party scene. Broken-hearted and pregnant, Kennedy returned home to begin a new life without Johnny. \n \"You don\'t know this, but that girl? She doesn\'t need a house. She doesn\'t even need an apartment. She would\'ve slept in the car. She wouldn\'t have complained at all about it. You didn\'t have to sell it, but you did, and as grateful as she is for that, she already feels guilty. She\'s worried, and she\'s scared, that this won\'t be a story of triumph. Because she believes in you. She wouldn\'t be there if she didn\'t. But the world isn\'t always kind to good people. Sometimes it eats them alive.\" \n Johnny grew up wealthy but in a very abusive household. Acting was his escape. He had no choice but to get away from his family in any way he could. But he never really left his demons behind and now that he is a world-famous superstar, he wants to make amends with Kennedy and with Madison, the daughter he never knew. \n \"I don\'t deserve her time, not in the least, but I\'m so desperate for some part of this woman back that I\'ll steal every second that I can get.\" \n Kennedy gave up everything for Madison, a gorgeous, smart and funny little girl. Kennedy works at a dead-end job, struggling to make ends meet. She is still in love with Johnny but has been hurt by him many times over the years. I was SO emotional while reading this book! It had everything I love about a second chance romance. The writing is clever and creative and completely engaging. I fell in love with Johnny and with little Madison! The book is heartbreaking, sexy, funny, heartfelt and completely uplifting. \n \"Whatever did it, I\'m glad you\'re sober, and I hope you stay that way. For Maddie\'s sake, yeah, because she deserves to know her dad, but for your sake, too. I know I was never enough for you, Jonathan, but I hope you find something that is.\" \n This story is perfectly balanced between both the hero and heroine\'s point of view. I adored the story of how Kennedy and Johnny first met and fell deeply in love. There are lots of steamy scenes as well as just the right amount of humor to balance out the very emotional story. This story gripped me from the first page and had me glued to the pages until the very end. I also loved how Kennedy was loyal and strong and smart and self-sufficient. She did not need the Porsches or the red carpets or the mansions. She only wanted Johnny to be able to follow his dreams. \n \"Wherever it takes you, I\'ll be there. \n \'Ghosted\' is another must-read book from JM Darhower.

Addictive, funny and fast-paced, this book might be my favorite in the series so far. \n Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep. This is a school filled with ultra-rich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions. Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school, Hartley. They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book. Hartley is not at all interested in bad-boy Easton so he settles for the friend zone. \n \"I need to treat her as a friend.

I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Easton\'s story!

This book just clicked for me. And I loved how funny Easton was. His humor and satire was just what this story needed. \n \"I might be small, but I have the lung capacity of a whale, so if you don\'t move I\'m gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire school is in this hallway rescuing me from you.\" \n I crack up. \"The oral Kraken? That sounds pretty dirty.\" \n \"I\'m thinking everything sounds dirty to you,\" she says dryly.\" \n This nook ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger which should not be a surprise for fans of this series. WOW!! But never fear, another book is coming in January!! I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if you\'re looking for a very smart and witty Young Adult story. \n \"I\'m the design flaw in the Royal family, the one who isn\'t quite like the others, the one who crashes and burns more often than not.\" \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)'),

Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I\'m not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. \n I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him.

I\'ll never forget it and it\'s sacred.\" \n The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let\'s just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. \n Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can\'t quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam? \n It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn\'t exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks. \n This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don\'t read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind.

Eve Dangerfield writes smart, funny, nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable. Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame.

(73, 10, 40, 4, '\"Out of all the places we could be, we\'re right here. At the same time.\" \n Colleen Hoover is at the top of my auto-buy list. Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in \'Without Merit\'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought. \n \"I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia. \n Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first. \n Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin\'s boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor. \n Merit is angry and surly and can\'t seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened? \n \"I\'m confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor\'s boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they\'re perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation. \n Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her family\'s past. It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be. Like all of Colleen Hoover\'s characters, Merit is unforgettable. She must make some hard choices about herself, her family and Sagan. \n \"Sagan just doesn\'t say mean things out loud. Maybe that\'s a product of how he was raised. Or maybe he\'s some kind of saint. Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals.\" \n I loved the message of this book!! The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable. The description of small-town Texas seems spot-on. Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story, and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing. Unconditional love, loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms. Hoover serves them up perfectly here. \n \"Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing a mistake deserves is forgiveness.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.'),

And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon\'s family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon. \n However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other. \n Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn\'t quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward\'s main characters, he is simply unforgettable!! \n His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective. \n \'Drunk Dial\' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did. \n Our story was a lot like a Rubik\'s Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together. \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)'),
(75, 10, 24, 4, 'If you love a sweet, verrrry sexy, low-angst romance, then this is the book for you! Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward cooked up another very readable yet super-hot contemporary romance. \n Dr. Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets single-mom Bridget in the cutest way possible. Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship. \n There\'s tons of humor, sexy talk and a hottie British doctor. What\'s not to love? After an embarrassing \"meet cute\" with Simon, Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet. It\'s not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain. He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual. So he proposes a deal: a no-strings attached, sex-only relationship until he leaves. \n The authors put a fresh spin on the friends-to-lovers trope that is sexy and enticing. There\'s not much angst but the storyline is fast-paced and engaging. Bridget doesn\'t want her son to get too attached to Simon so she is careful not to get attached. But Simon soon finds himself falling in love with Bridget and her son, too. \n \"The sexy, blond, god of a doctor whom I\'d masturbated to for weeks after the fish hook incident...was now my roommate.\" \n This is a swoony romance with lots of heart and tons of heat. The authors always throw in a twist for dramatic tension and it worked perfectly here! The letter-writing is a cute addition and I loved the funny, charming, dirty-talking Brit!! Another passionate, sweet and heart-warming story from a great writing duo. \n \"It\'s proof you hooked me from the very beginning, luv.\" \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)'),

Nothing too over the top here, just a sweet and sexy small-town romance featuring one hot cop and a feisty heroine. \n Leah is determined to own the bar where she works and I loved that aspect of the book. The author also seems to have a wicked sense of humor which shows in the funny banter and the hilarious Matthew McConaughey references. Leah lost her first love to an overdose, and he also happened to be Adam\'s best friend - Adam, the rigid, by-the-book policeman who seems determined to punish Leah for her past mistakes. \n Adam is charitable and gorgeous and kind and protective. He has made it his mission in life to rid the town of narcotics. When Leah is sentenced to community service under Adam\'s supervision, the sparks begin to fly. \n Even though the setting is in the Midwest, this story has almost a sassy, Southern feel to it, reminiscent of Abbi Glines and Harper Sloan\'s early books. I love a blue-collar hero and Luke fits the bill perfectly! \n Adam was cold and harsh and downright mean for much of the story, until Leah begins to break through to him. The chemistry between these two was HOT HOT HOT! I applaud Ms. Colette for her strong and sassy heroine and absolutely loved Leah. She wasn\'t just a party girl and earns the respect of everyone around her. \'Wrecked\' is a funny, sexy, small-town romance that is a great way to spend a few hours. \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.'),
(77, 11, 73, 4, 'The First Taste features Andrew, a single dad from Slip of the Tongue, one of my favorite books. His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that\'s for sure - he\'s totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. \n They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew\'s daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. \n Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it\'s not enough to scare me away. In fact, it\'s the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me. It makes me want to put up a fight. \n The First Taste is a classic opposites-attract story, filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty. Jessica Hawkins is great at writing uber-sexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted, he is a VERY giving lover. The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around. \n \"I want to undress you, stretch you out on my bed, fingers to toes. Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you can\'t handle it another second.\" \n I love stories with single dads and while this story did not pack as much of an emotional punch as Slip of the Tongue, I still loved the story and the way Amelia and Andrew\'s relationship grew and developed.

BOOK. \n A sharp and insightful commentary on our modern culture and obsession with celebrity, \'The Idea of You\' is also a fantastic, sexy romance. This book really did it for me. If this is Robinne Lee\'s first book, I cannot wait see what comes next! \n Solene is a sophisticated, 39 year old divorced working mom who finds herself swept up into an exciting and sexy relationship with the world-famous Hayes Campbell, the 20 year old member of a famous \"boy band\". She is an educated and successful gallerist who is divorced from her ex-husband, who has a younger girlfriend. The world does not take kindly to Solene\'s relationship with Hayes, mainly because of the 20 year age difference. I loved the commentary on ageism in our society today. The public will accept an older man with a younger girlfriend but frowns upon the older woman/younger man dynamic. \n Solene is acutely aware of the age difference but is enjoying an awakening of sorts with Hayes, Ah, the joys of a younger boyfriend! What starts out as \"just lunch\" soon becomes much, much more. \n \"I just want to look at you for a moment.\" \n \"You\'ve been looking at me for over an hour.\" \n \"Yeah, but before I was trying not to be obvious about it. Come here.\" He led me over to the daybed against the far wall and pulled me onto his lap. I could feel him through his pants. Oh, the wonders of twenty. \n Solene at first tries to hide her relationship with Hayes from her young daughter. I knew this was going to be a disaster and her daughter at first does not handle the news well at all. But doesn\'t Solene deserve to be happy? She struggles not only with her ex-husband\'s reaction to the news but also with her daughter\'s. \n The entire time Isabelle had been just across the hall on the phone with her friend, oblivious to her mother going down the rabbit hole. Face-first. \n One of the things I loved most about this book was the sharp look at our obsession with celebrity. Hayes could not go anywhere without being mobbed, and even a causal trip to the store to buy a shirt led to a mob scene. He was used to it; Solene was not. This story made me re-think every headline I read about celebrities. Hayes wanted Solene to know him, and NOT \"the idea\" of him. Hayes was tender, sweet, funny, sexy and much wiser than his 20 years. \n \"You want to be kissed, Solene?\" His hands were in my hair, pushing it off of my face, cradling my neck. \n \"Yes.\" I nodded. \n \"You think you can handle that?\" \n \"I\'ll see what I can do.\" \n Robinne Hill gets her locations right. From Miami, to Malibu, to Manhattan and Paris, I felt as if I was THERE, experiencing the cafes, the clubs, the chic art galleries and the screaming fans at the huge concerts. This book really checked all the boxes for me!! I simply cannot recommend it highly enough. I am having a hard time moving on from this book. Would I love a sequel? YES. But I would also gladly welcome another book from Ms. Hill. Grab \'The Idea of You\' and enjoy a fabulous time with this perfect beach read. I adored it. \n Favorite quotes: \n \"You\'re making me blush,\" he laughed, tipping his head back. His jawline from this angle was well-defined, exquisite, like art.

If you are looking for something totally light and sexy, this book is for you! \n Madeleine is an adorable and quirky heroine who is trying her best to get her life together. As a somewhat unsuccessful realtor, she adores her giant dog named Mouse (cute, right?) and loves her family and best friend Daisy. But her love life? Non-existent. DOA. That is, until the new veterinarian Dr. Adam Foxe arrives in town. But the good doctor is coming off a bitter break-up and is cynical and not looking for love, etc etc. Until Mouse (and Madeleine crash into his life!) \n They strike up a mutually beneficial deal. A fake dating arrangement to satisfy Adam\'s nosy family and he will buy a house through Madeleine. Let the hilarity (and hormones) ensue! \n \"No. No. A family barbecue is serious! This was not part of the deal.\" \n \"Technically, you agreed to do anything I needed you to do.\" \n \"That\'s when I thought you\'d be asking me for a lung or something!\" \n \"So you were prepared to donate an organ, but a family barbecue is suddenly too much pressure?\" \n \"Don\'t try to be cute.\" \n Adam\'s family is charmed by Madeleine. And who wouldn\'t be? She is a sincere and honest and refreshingly REAL MC. \n \"And you brought cookies?\" she asks, eyeing the Tupperware in my hand. \n \"Freshly baked this morning,\" I brag. \n She turns over her shoulder to Adam, who\'s following us into the house with Mouse by his side. \"I love her already!\" \n I bask in her praise. After the months from hell I\'ve had recently, this is a much-needed reprieve. Hell, if all else fails, maybe I\'ll date Adam\'s mom? \n \'The Foxe & the Hound\" is a delightfully sexy story with the perfect amount of humor and heat. I loved the banter, the characters and the charming small-town Texas setting. I swear, R.S. Grey could be a TV comedy writer, that\'s how funny her dialogue is!! \n \"I want to take a pair of scissors to her loud highlights, but I misplaced the scissors I usually keep in my top drawer a few months ago. Instead, I\'m forced to stand, hang up on Daisy, and follow Lori over to the conference room with pen and paper in hand. We\'re the first two to arrive. She takes her usual spot beside Helen\'s chair, and I pick a spot on the opposite end of the table. Her perfume is strong. Chanel number five, she told me once, bragging. Oh really? On you it smells like a number two. \n This was THE perfect read for a summer day or a weekend at the beach. I fell in love with Adam and Madeleine and the fictional setting of Hamilton, Texas. Bravo, Ms. Grey!! Keep writing more books like this one. \n \"We should slow down,\" I sputter just before his mouth falls to my chest. \n He swirls his tongue around my nipple and my eyes pinch closed.

Lots of unexpected twists and turns! \n I loved the storyline and the originality of the plot. Even though I was familiar with Anthony Bear and Christy from the Nine Minutes series, this book really explored their relationship and Anthony\'s early life. \n I could not WAIT for this book to come out since Beth Flynn is a very special and talented writer. The Nine Minutes Series is one of my all-time FAVORITE biker romances and I recommend it to anyone who will listen! \n Anthony is a fighter. Faced with racism from a young age, he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida. He is Boss. When a large debt is owed to him, he sets out to collect. \n He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him, but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected. Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong. \n Christy judged Anthony at first, too. Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was, they both surprise each other along the way. \n Although I finished this book, it was a little slow going for me at times. The third-person voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters. That being said, this was an incredibly inventive story and as always, I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynn\'s books. The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot. I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynn\'s cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book! \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.');

And please don\'t read any spoilers! The author just totally blew me away with the plot and the characters and the FEELS! \n Let me just say that Parker was one of my favorite MC\'s EVER.

But there is so much more to her story!! \n \"If Amazon Prime offered a life, she would have one-clicked the hell out of it and selected recurring monthly delivery.\" \n This book is NOT what you think. The plot is inventive and sexy and emotional. It is pure Jewel E. Ann. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I did not want it to end! Parker finds herself in THE one situation that she swore she would never be in. Funny how life is, right? Despite her best intentions, she realizes that life is not black and white but is shades of grey. And family does mean everything. \n \"Temptation no longer resided in his blind spot. She lived a hundred yards away. \n This book is funny and steamy and just plain REAL. I am trying not to give away any of the plot because this book is best read without knowing anything about the story or the characters.

The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. \n Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author\'s previous book \'The Widow\' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate\'s style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. \n \"I\'ve always thought that\'s a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don\'t they?\" \n Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the \"Building Site Baby\' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela\'s family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. \n The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. \n \'The Child\' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. \n There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel. The conclusion was enormously satisfying! Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story. \n \"People say what doesn\'t kill you makes you stronger. They say that when you been through something terrible ... But it doesn\'t. It breaks your bones, leaving everything splintered and held together with grubby bandages and yellowing sticky tape.

Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery. \n I\'m a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse\'s friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It\'s no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise!

Finally, Emmy broke away. \n \"Sorry. I have to go,\" she mumbled before racing to the door. \n \"What was that? Do you know her?\" Jess asked. \n Yeah. I knew her. \"She\'s my wife.\" \n There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there\'s a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana. \n Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn\'t know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the \"wow\" factor that \'The Coppersmith Farmhouse\' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters. \n I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters. Ms. Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing. \'The Clover Chapel\' is a heart-warming, funny, sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word.

Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and \'Lick\' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I\'m so glad that I did.

No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end. \n \"You\'re here?\" \n \"Yeah.\" \n \"Why?\" \n \"Because this is where you are,\" he said, as if it were obvious. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that\'s IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! \n He wasn\'t a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren\'t her scene but this guy\'s hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox\'s pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual.\" \n Dean is one of the most original MC\'s I\'ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. \n \"You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?\" \n Dean and Ash were perfect together. There\'s tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the \'Princess Bride\' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can\'t put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but \'Open Hearts\' has \"it.\" I couldn\'t book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, \'Open Hearts\' is one of my favorite books this year. \n Favorite quotes: \n \"He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y.

The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance. \n I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more! If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of second-chance romance, you will love this one! \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)'),
(87, 12, 28, 4, '4.5 Stars \n Holy moly!!! What to say about this delicious, erotic, COMPLETELY taboo romance? Enter at your own risk!! Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster - my emotions were all over the place. Ms. Saffron Kent is an author to watch. And Professor Thomas Abrams? I honestly have no words. \n Some books have \"it\" - an undefinable quality that hooks the reader from the beginning and doesn\'t let go. \'The Unrequited\' has \"it.\" Once I started reading this steamy forbidden romance, I simply could not put it down. \n \"Bravery is like falling in love. You donaEUR(tm)t know if the person will reciprocate, but still you fall. \" \n Heed the warnings in the synopsis, and if you are not a fan of forbidden romance or cheating, then move along. But there is SO much more to this book! Thomas and Layla\'s story is very nuanced and adult and very complicated. And so, so erotic!! \n \"The Harlot fell in love with the Fire-breather. It was beautiful and right. It was wrong and ugly, just like the earth beneath my feet. It was tragic and ecstatic. It was everything IaEUR(tm)d hoped love could be.\" \n Saffon Kent did a fantastic job creating two very different protagonists. Layla is passionate, self-deprecating, very open and brutally honest. She is a true original. Thomas is brilliant, sexy, introspective and sarcastic. Layla is heartbroken and possibly crazy after being rejected by her one true love. She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy. She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams\' poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head. He is rude to her and sees through her charade. \n But Thomas has secrets, too. Yes he is married but there is much, much more to his story than just that simple fact. Cold, aloof and arrogant, he is the complete opposite of Layla. You just know that Thomas and Layla will be a total train wreck together, but you just can\'t look away.'),
(88, 12, 63, 5, '\"You smile like the devil,\" Mona said. \n \"The devil doesn\'t smile,\" he said. \"The devil smirks.\" \n STUNNING!! Ms. Reisz proves once again she is the Queen of erotica. The story and characters are all richly drawn and unforgettable. Mona Lisa St. James made a promise to her mother that she would do anything at all to save their art gallery. But the gallery is in financial trouble and she must sell it. And soon. \n But then a handsome Englishman arrives and makes her an irresistible offer. He will save her gallery. But she must agree to be his for one year. \n \"You were meant to do this,\" he said softly. \"You\'ll see.\" \n \"Why me?\" she asked. \"Millions of women in this country, millions in yours...why me?\" \n \"Millions of paintings in this world. Only one Mona Lisa. Billions of women in this world. Only one you, Mona Lisa St. James.\" \n And so begins the most erotic and sensual adventures Mona has ever had. A sexual awakening of sorts, Mona and the mysterious Malcolm shares his most erotic and depraved fantasies. Yet each and every encounter is sexy and beautiful and simply stunning!! Malcolm is judgement-free and slowly begins to understand her true nature and what life has in store for her. \n I can\'t even begin to describe how incredibly sensual and hot the scenes between Mona and Malcolm are. Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy, interwoven with mythology, history and lush eroticism. \n \"Is this all a dream?\" That\'s the only thing that makes any sense. \n \"You aren\'t dreaming,\" he said, and she knew that was true. She was awake and had been every time they had met. \"But if you were a dream, would you want to wake up?\" he asked. \n A good question. A fair question. A hard question, but one she answered easily. \n \"Never.\" \n I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story. It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying! I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm. This book is unlike anything I\'ve ever read. Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill. \'The Red\' is a must-read for all erotic romance lovers!! \n \"Do anything you must, but keep me forever.\" \n (With many thanks to the author for a review copy.)'),

(90, 13, 93, 4, '\"I\'m curious whether you could ever like me, whether someone like you could be friends with someone like me.\" \n Sweet and lovely and important and fresh. Love the message of this book! \n Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE. On the one hand is Tanner, a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is, On the other hand is Sebastian, a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church. Where homosexuality is forbidden. \n Tanner moved from California to Provo, Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there. Although \"out\" to his family, he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates, friends and the town. He falls hard for Sebastian, when he meets Seb in a writing class. Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town. He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course. \n \"Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen--which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah--with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories.\" Not to mention I\'m a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town. \n Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian, but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated. He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay? \n \"But how can I send my heart to him when he\'s just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn\'t speak its language?\" \n My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian\'s religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental. \n I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love. \n There are no evil characters here. Sebastian\'s parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner\'s heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way. \n Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb\'s parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner. \n These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love. \n Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a \"half-Jew in a Mormon town\" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That\'s my dilemma.) \n Hopefully the LDS Church will have a \"revelation\" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church. \n \"To think that God loves the trees, but condemns that blossoming thing they do in the spring.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(91, 13, 87, 4, 'First let me be clear that I ADORE Mia Asher and love her books. And this book was a perfectly sexy, fast-paced and truly engrossing story. And the cover...WOW!! One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book. \n The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic. Just what I love in a contemporary romance. Valentina has been hurt by her husband William, and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there. Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife, and re-kindle their love for each other. \n Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage, and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again. She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day, and falls in love with the city. \n \"My arms outstretched, I\'d danced to the vibrant music of life. I prayed for romance, adventure, the unknown. I wanted to fall in love and love to the point of no return. I wanted the turmoil, the stress, the upheaval, and chaos--the Sturm und Drang.\" \n And Sebastien. HOLY HELL!! I loved him from the minute he was introduced into the story!! A sexy French artist, what could be bad, non? Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings, there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris, what his artistic process was, just, nothing. I would have loved some discussion of his art. Something to fill out this part of the storyline. \n But I digress. Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect. Sebastien has been emotionally closed off for many years, but finds himself falling in love with the beautiful, kind and sweet Valentina. I adore a good love triangle and I really felt tremendous sympathy for Valentina. She truly was torn between her husband and Sebastien. \n \"One day you\'re going to stop running away from me. And when that day finally comes, I\'ll be here waiting for you,\" he whispers softly, his words a caress. \"Now go ... before I change my mind and decide it doesn\'t please me to share you with others after all.\" \n There were some minor inconsistencies in the story but overall I loved the book until the last part. The plot just descended for me into soap-opera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine - but it just didn\'t work for me here. Fans of Mia Asher will love this book, it just was not a favorite of mine. I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books! \n Favorite quote: \n \"Il n\'y a qu\'un bonheur dans la vie, c\'est d\'aimer et d\'etre aime.\" There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved. \n Our bodies are covered in sweat. The room smells like our dirty souls. And I fucking love it. \n There are others with far more classical features than hers. But none of them can hold a candle to her. She reminds me of the sea: untamed, unpredictable, but beautiful, so damn beautiful.'),
(92, 13, 23, 5, '4.5 - 5 GORGEOUS STARS \n \"No rules. Live out loud. Find the sunshine.\" \n Simply stunning!! Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction. Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart! \n Called a contemporary romance \"with paranormal elements,\" I found this book to be incredibly moving and very, very touching. I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance. And please don\'t be put off by this being the second book in a series. I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot. This book is a total standalone! \n Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life. For Nik, he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona, it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica. And when they meet, it is pure magic. \n \"But it wasn\'t what was wrong with me, anymore. It was what was right. The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin, and when I inhaled, it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away. The thrumming life all around me grew quiet. For the first time, I felt close to peace, and I wanted more.\" \n What begins as a one-night stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep, unbreakable connection. Emma Scott\'s love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read! \n \"Nikolai Alexei,\" she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness. \"Who are you?\" \n There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes. But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love. Once again, I won\'t soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott. A must-read! \n \"Love and hope,\" she said. \"That\'s life to me.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(93, 13, 100, 5, '4.5 - 5 Stars!!! \n \"You know your reputation is just what everyone else thinks of you, your character is what you really are.\" \n Run, don\'t walk, to read this fantastic sports romance!! I am officially in love with Mariana Zapata\'s writing. This is my second book by this fantastic author and I am currently reading The Wall of Winnipeg and Me. I can\'t get enough!! \n I adore her strong heroines. Sal is a star soccer player in her Texas hometown. She\'s driven, focused and yes, a little socially awkward. She is absolutely shocked when she learns that her childhood idol, the superstar Reiner Kulti, is going to be one of her team\'s assistant coaches. \n I just sat there with the phone still to my face, lying in my bed two hundred miles away from where I\'d grown up, soaking in the idea that Reiner Kulti--the Reiner Kulti-- was going to be my coach. I swallowed the nerves and anticipation down. No big deal. Right. \n Oh, and she also was sure that one day, she and Kulti would be married. She worshipped him until the cold reality of the sport brought her idol down a notch or ten and her dreams of a happily ever after were destroyed. Sal tries to hold it together and play it cool when Kulti arrives but she is starstruck just like everyone else. \n To my absolute horror, my inner thirteen-year-old, the one that had planned on marrying this guy and having soccer-playing super-babies with him, peeked in and reminded me she\'d been around once. \n Kulti makes no friends when he joins the coaching staff. He is surly, silent and downright mean to everyone, players and fans alike. But Sal keeps reminded herself that he is human, just like everyone else, no better and no worse, and gradually, they reach a truce and an understanding. They actually become friends, with Kulti confiding in Sal that he doesn\'t trust anyone but he sees a real goodness and honesty in Sal. \n This book is a fantastic, enjoyable, slow-burn romance that had me literally staying up all night to finish. There is just something about Mariana Zapata\'s writing that is insanely addictive and completely REAL. My heart literally burst with emotion and I fell in love with Kulti. BUT do not expect instal-love here. In fact I wasn\'t even sure the main characters were ever going to have a civil conversation, let alone fall in love!! \n \"I used to have a huge crush on you.\" \n The German blinked at me and I had to fight the urge to twitch -- that would just make me look like I had something to hide. Which I did, but it wasn\'t like I wanted him to know that once upon a time there\'d been posters of him all over my wall. Or that \'Sal loves Kulti\' had been written in marker on every single notebook and folder I owned in middle school. \n \"Used to. Used. To. I was a little kid back then.\" \n Kulti seems hostile to everyone, including Sal. She slowly realizes that having worldwide fame and fortune might not be all that it\'s cracked up to be and that Kulti really can\'t lead a \'normal\' life. Slowly Sal and Kulti become friends which poses a huge problem since he is one of the coaching staff. But the lines become blurred because Sal still has a huge crush on the very intimidating German. \n I\'m not going to lie, not even a little bit. Besides a big butt, I had a thing for guys that spoke different languages. While Reiner Kulti was every bit as impressive of a male specimen as you could get physically, the way he spoke Spanish multiplied his attractiveness by about thirty percent. Okay, thirty percent minimum. But it wasn\'t like I could or would think about that too much. He was my coach. And I was his friend. Or something like that. \n This book is funny, sexy, romantic, exciting, action-packed...need I say more? Even if you are not a fan of sports romance, you will fall in love with Kulti. The author either really knows the sport of soccer (or football depending on your country) or she did some phenomenal research. The story was a pure delight from beginning to end. The last 20% of the book had me in tears!! I cannot recommend Kulti highly enough!! Mariana Zapata can do no wrong in my eyes. Kulti and Sal share a deep connection and a beautiful love story. This book is a must-read! \n \"This,\" he pointed between us. \"This is what matters. You are my gift, my second chance, and I will cherish you and your dream. I will protect both of you.'),
(94, 13, 61, 5, '4.5 Stars \n LOVE LOVE LOVE this series! While not a standalone, \'American Prince\' is just as magical and enticing as the first book. Without giving too much away, this book is Embry\'s story. Bad-boy Embry, who grows up to become the Vice-President of the United States. But he has always felt unworthy, of love, friendship and trust. \n \"I grew up around power, around the kind of people who exercised authority with effortless ease, but I myself had spent most of my life dodging any and all responsibility. Consequences were something to be charmed and flirted out of, other people were worth only how much fun they could give me. I had next to no practice taking care of other people...I could barely keep myself out of trouble.\" \n Poor Embry! He is selfless and misunderstood. I devoured this book and love how Sierra Simone reveals the real reasons why Embry acts the way he does. I loved reading his point of view of his relationship with Ash and with Greer. Yet another book by Ms. Simone that I could NOT put down! \n \"And if I ever thought Ash held all the power in their relationship, I see it clearly now. Embry holds my husband\'s heart in his hands and he doesn\'t even know it. He\'s too busy looking at the details of Ash\'s faces to see the expression, too busy being in love to see how loved he is.\" \n One of the things I love about this series is that there is no judgment from the author about the characters\' choices or their lifestyle. They are just themselves. Always honest with other and always loving. Ms. Simone\'s great care in creating these characters is evident. This book ends on a cliffhanger but the final book will be released very soon so there\'s plenty of time to read this series before \'American King\' comes out. This series is totally engaging and entertaining and I highly recommend it!! \n \"I\'m done running from you,\" I said honestly. \"I tried and it didn\'t matter--you haunted me everywhere I went.\" \n \"And you haunted me,\" he murmured, rolling over to press his lips against mine once more. \"My little prince.\" \n And so the next act in our tragedy began.'),

Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far, I have enjoyed the stories. Although \'Sweet Rivalry\' is a standalone, Ryder first appeared in \'Sweet Cheeks\' as Saylor\'s brother. This novella is a steamy, sweet and fast-paced romance that you can devour in one sitting. This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Bromberg\'s steamy yet witty writing style. \n Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project. They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything. But Ryder is determined to win this time. Of course, they have some major chemistry, but business is business, right? \n \"Beard burn is a real thing. \n And oh my God it is everything I wanted it to be and then some. \" \n I always love the strong heroines in Kristy Bromberg\'s books. That is one of my favorites things about her writing. No wallflowers here! If you are looking for a fast, sexy, witty read with a guaranteed happy ending, then \'Sweet Rivalry\' is just the ticket. My one complaint? That this story wasn\'t longer! Maybe we will get a full-length book about these two someday! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(96, 14, 93, 4, '4.5 Stars!!! \n Romance lovers, rejoice and meet your next book boyfriend, Gabriel Dalton! \n \"You can\'t fix me you know...\" \n Mia Sheridan really knows how to create characters who have damaged souls and rough beginnings. People who are bullied, shunned and shut out from normal human interaction and love. And she\'s done it again with \'Most of All You.\' Gabriel and Crystal\'s story is a rough journey and uncomfortable in parts, but so beautiful and uplifting that it is well worth the journey. \n \"He needed someone warm and caring. Someone who would nurture him and piece back together the broken parts. Someone who would look in his eyes and be his calming spirit. I was not that girl... \n This is in the end a totally swoon-y contemporary romance that has just the right amount of gritty reality to keep the story interesting. The main characters have both experienced deep heartache and childhood trauma that would break an ordinary person. Although this is most definitely a love story, the lovely way that Mia Sheridan treats Gabriel and Crystal\'s new and fragile friendship is the center and heart of the story. Books like this are why I read contemporary romance. Passion, honesty, damaged people simply searching for ordinary kindness - this book has it all. \n \"I was spellbound, caught once again in his gaze. No one has ever looked at me the way Gabriel was right then, not in all my life.\" \n While the more sinister elements of the plot are not detailed at length, there is enough revealed about both characters\' pasts that explains why they act the way they do and the lives they currently lead. Gabriel is such a beautiful person that my heart ached for him throughout the book. \n \"Choice is such a loaded word, isn\'t it? Choices, though our own, were so weighted down with all the things that had come before, so stained with the messes of our past.\" \n This is a slow-burn romance but Gabriel and Crystal\'s story is SO worth the wait! Insta-love would NOT have worked here and I\'m glad Mia Sheridan did not give into that often-used trope. Both main characters needed time to overcome their emotional barriers. And it felt oh so sweet when they finally come together. \n \"I wasn\'t a victim. I was a survivor...\" \n Mia Sheridan never fails to entice her readers. This is a heartfelt, sweet and very story and perfect for any romance reader. There is not too much darkness (I don\'t want to give too much away about the plot) but just enough to add drama and tension to the story. I guarantee you will fall in love with Gabriel Dalton! \n \"The longer she\'d touched me, the more a yearning rose in my soul, so strong it took my breath.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.'),
(97, 14, 62, 3, 'I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it. Yes the plot is a little far-fetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZY-hot. \n The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is, well, a hot cop. \n \"There\'s always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them, even. In a place like Kansas, he\'s the closest thing we have to a rock star.\" \n Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That\'s pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the \"Kelley Trio\" - yes, Officer Kelley! \n Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby! \n \"Megan, you never told me your brother was a hot.\" Oh my God. I didn\'t just say that. \n But I totally did. My face is heated with embarrassment. \"A cop! I meant a cop.\" \n This is a fun, sexy story with a very low angst factor.

(98, 15, 83, 5, '4 1/2 Stars!! \n What a beautiful, gripping and intense story! I jumped into \'Preston\'s Honor\' without knowing too much about the plot. There is so much to love about this book: second-chance love, burning passion, forgiveness and compassion. Lia, Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California. Lia\'s mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough. Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school, her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her. \n \"Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Me.\" \n My heart!! Both brothers loved Lia, but through a series of events, it is Cole who begins to date Lia. Life happens, Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town. There are no opportunities for her to continue her education, and she is resigned to accept her lot in life. I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nation\'s migrant farm workers. Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother. \n The only bright spot in her life is Preston. She is overjoyed when he returns to town. Bound together by a tragedy, it is difficult to know whether their love will survive. \n \"Annalia. Christ. Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful. I gripped the hair at my forehead, a sound of frustration coming up my throat. Hadn\'t that always been the case? Only this time . . . this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart. I\'d felt . . . breathless. Struck mute. Consumed.\" \n Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness? Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them. Lia was a lovely, honest, caring and gorgeous character (inside and out) and Preston was magnificent. My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story! I was desperate for these two to find happiness. \n \"Thank you, Preston.\" For being my friend once, for giving me my first dance, for watching over me. It was all I had. It would have to be enough. \n Once again, Mia Sheridan does not disappoint. I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances, redemption and mercy. And the Prologue was a stunner!! Happy tears were flowing all around. \n \"Or actually, maybe this is exactly where we were meant to start. Tonight. This is our beginning, Annalia.\"'),

She is living in a rundown motel and has lost everything. But she is determined to get back what is precious to her and \'The Knight\' is another deliciously dark romance that features some great characters and writing. \n Gabriel really cares for Avery. He is outwardly cruel but their scenes together are everything I love about Skye Warren\'s writing. He was almost brutally cruel in the first book but here, he seems to finally show his true feelings. But Avery wants nothing more then to get revenge on the man she believes led to her father\'s downfall. Make no mistake, Gabriel Miller is still a harsh and brutal figure, and he still remains mysterious. \n I love the supporting characters in this book and would love to read more about Avery\'s mother! The circumstances surrounding her death become more and more mysterious and I hope that the third book in this series tells more of her story. \'The Knight\' ends on a surprising note and I can\'t wait to read \'The Castle,\' the third book in this series. \n Skye Warren once again delivers the goods in this story. This series is dark, very sensual and dangerous. Highly recommend these books for all lovers of dark and sexy romance.'),

Emerie and Drew \"meet cute\" and I was drawn in from the very beginning. What separates Vi Keeland\'s romances from the rest of the books out there is the heated chemistry between her characters and their wonderful banter. Emerie is new in town and winds up renting space from Drew, an aggressive divorce attorney. He is a commitment-phobe, for very good reason.

This house might be simple, but it\'s ambition is extraordinary.\" \n A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators\' minds. \n The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. \n Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. \n Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. \n \"That\'s all anyone\'s looking for really, isn\'t it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\" \n The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. \n The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then \"The Girl Before\' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers. \n (Copy provided by the publisher via NetGalley.)'),
(102, 15, 84, 4, '3.5 Stars \n \'Bombshell\' was not quite for me, but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance. I adore C.D. Reiss\'s writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO, although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing, it just didn\'t work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay, which is fine, but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me. \n I didn\'t really connect with the MC\'s until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them, but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn\'t work for me as a romance novel. \n The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D. Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes! \n (ARC provided by Montlake in return for an honest review.)');

The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing. \n I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt. Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road. \n The motorist ends up dead. Cass feels guilty, but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine, making dinner plans with friends, and even rather significant purchases. Her mother suffered from early-onset Alzheimer\'s. What is happening to Cass? \n Cass\'s mental well-being soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother. \n I literally could not put this book down! I FELT Cass\'s hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book. This is my first book by B.A. Paris and she has now become one of my faves!! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

Hands down, her second-chance romances are among my absolute favorite stories! Her main characters always have tons of heart, soul and chemistry, And humor! And I adore the catchy title of this book. \n Mack is devoted to his young son Johan who he enrolled in Frankie\'s class in Boston. Mack has broken up with his son\'s mother, with whom he had a long-term relationship. Mack and Frankie were roommates years before, with Frankie losing her heart completely to Mack. But they were not meant to be, and went their separate ways. \n Now Mack has shown up, determined to win Frankie back. She is the love of his life. The problem is that she now is living with her current boyfriend, an older, very stable college professor who adores her. What will Frankie do? Told in alternating POV\'s, we read how Mack and Frankie\'s love blossomed several years before. They are simply meant to be. \n \"Remember all those things you wished I could do to you? I\'m about to make all your wishes come true if you let me.\" \n All the moms in school pursue Mack who is the resident DILF. Penelope Ward is seriously FUNNY and there are some hilarious moments in this book! But at its heart it is a gorgeous second-chance romance as only Ms. Ward can write. \n Mack Daddy is SERIOUSLY sexy and sizzling hot. I adored the supporting cast of characters and I fell in love with Mack\'s son Jonah. I also adored Frankie\'s boyfriend and felt very sad when she had to make her choice between Mack, the love of her life, and her current boyfriend. Ms. Ward handles this situation with grace and sensitivity. This book is warm and sweet and sexy all at once.

(106, 15, 66, 4, 'CD Reiss is one of my favorite romance authors. Her writing is mature, sexy, nuanced and never fails to grab me. And I do love books about marriage. Separation Games was a perfect conclusion to the first book in this series. Marriage Games ended with an unusual twist and I absolutely loved how the author worked things out between Adam and Diana. I feel both of their pain, confusion and longing. \n And Adam, OMG! He was one of the author\'s most memorable heroes. Wow. Both Diana and Adam are mature, smart and very driven. This book is off-the-charts sexy and is the perfect read for fans of mature contemporary romance with an erotic twist. \n \"Beg to come.\" \n \"Please.\" \n \"Beg harder.\" \n Adam and Diana do not have a easy path but when they do finally resolve their issues, it is explosive. I have never read a book by CD Reiss that I didn\'t love, and this duet is no exception. The supporting characters are all very well-written and the New York City setting adds another exciting layer to the story. The Epilogue is fantastic! I was actually sorry to see this story end.

Her story has been a long time coming and it hit all the hight notes. Only Kristen Ashley can make a novella feel as satisfying as a full-length novel. Marcus and Daisy are pure KA gold. All of the wonderful writing, emotion, plot and LOVE that you expect from Kristen Ashley are here. And kudos to the author for tackling a very sensitive subject and handling it perfectly. If you need a hit of Kristen Ashley, \'Rock Chick Reawakening\' is your answer.

(108, 15, 58, 4, 'This book started off as something else and then turned into a very adult, very erotic, very explicit romance that I really fell for. \n The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan. I will admit that the beginning of this book, which was released as a separate novella, did not really hold my interest. But when the book fast-forwards 10 years and Sabrina has moved to New York, WOW!! The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang. \n Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston. She is smart, driven and extremely competent. But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston. \n This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies. So if that is not your thing, then you will not like this story. But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions, then you will love this book. \n Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan. But he is distant, cold, sarcastic. She and Weston have a fling, but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan, and cannot resist his allure. \n \"I don\'t want you to touch me like Weston,\" I said, once and for all. \"I don\'t want Weston! I want you!\" \n Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile. \"I know. I was waiting for you to know too.\" \n Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan. He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot, she cannot stay away. I felt that this book really picked up around the 40% mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try. \n Why the 4 stars? I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan. The sexy times are off the charts. I did not love Sabrina\'s lack of self-esteem and her feelings of worthlessness. I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants. I found this book to be very engrossing, surprising and very, very adult. So that for me is a win. \n I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine. I hope we get Donovan\'s POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovan\'s story!! \n \"Were you even going to say goodbye?\" I asked, pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping he\'d say he\'d changed his mind about going at all. \n He smiled lazily. \"I don\'t know what you mean. I\'m still here.\" \n \"You\'re just as much already gone.\" \n His face was in the shadows, but I could feel his expression sober even if I couldn\'t see it. \"I\'m less gone than you\'d imagine.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Mandy\'s had her eye on Shade but didn\'t make a move because she already had a boyfriend, who was a total loser. \n \"When I first met Rebel, I\'d teased him about having a crush on Shade because my new boyfriend couldn\'t stop talking about the man. Then I\'d met Shade in person. Now I got it. Rebel worked hard to make sure everyone knew he was a big, bad biker. Shade didn\'t have to work at it. He just was big and bad.\" \n Joanna Wylde\'s MC books are among my favorite stories and this story reminded me why I love her so much. Her women are strong, resilient and tough as nails. Not to mention down-to-earth and self-deprecating. Mandy can\'t resist the allure of Shade, the President of the Reaper\'s MC, even though she is conned into being alone with him for the first time. \n \"He was the biggest, nastiest bastard in the room--not to mention easy on the eyes--and deep down inside I just knew we\'d make beautiful babies together. Too bad I already sort of had a boyfriend... Shade was so potent we\'d probably have quintuplets or something crazy on the first try. You don\'t even want a baby, I reminded my quivering ovaries. Jump him! Jump him and ride him like a cowgirl! they snapped back. Just think how sexy and strong he is. His sperm could kick Rebel\'s ass and you know it!\" \n Shade is NOT looking for an \"old lady,\" or even anything more than a one night stand. He makes this very clear to Mandy. Which is fine with her, because she has had nothing but rotten luck with her previous boyfriends. \n \"Girls wanted flowers and roses and forever. I wanted the road under my tires and something new on the horizon. Never understood why so many of my brothers were willing to settle down in one place. I wasn\'t that guy. Never had been. Never would be.\" \n There\'s lots of action and lots of steamy, dirty scenes and just lots of fun in this story. I adore Joanna Wylde and this story satisfied my craving for her MC stories. Loved visiting with the Reapers MC again. \'Shade\'s Lady\' was a witty, funny, sexy and fast read. Highly recommend for all fans of MC romance. \n \"I\'d never been much of a believer, but in that moment I saw Heaven and it was glorious.\"'),

But overall, Hail Mary was a deliciously naughty sports romance with some unforgettable passion between the main characters. Nicola Rendell is definitely a writer to watch and her book kept me engaged and laughing until the very end. \n This is a dirty, dirty book and LOTS of fun. Even if you don\'t usually read sports romance, give Hail Mary a try! You will love this very spicy and very funny story. I loved that Jimmy and Mary were mature adults, with families, jobs, friends and very full lives. Jimmy had a sweet side and Mary was absolutely lovable and perfectly relatable. Yes, there is a touch if insta-love but it worked perfectly in this story. And the Chicago setting was fantastic. \n Hail Mary was a well-written, engaging, romantic and hilarious story with maybe THE sexiest scene I have read this year. There, I said it. Hello, champagne bottle! *Fans self* I truly loved this book and love this author\'s fresh writing style. What detracted from the story for me was the unprotected sex when Jimmy and Mary hardly knew each other (sorry, a big turn-off for me). I also found it a little unbelievable that Mary had no clue who Jimmy was, when they both lived in the same city where he was a famous football star. But, other readers didn\'t seem to mind so read this little gem of a story and judge for yourself! It\'s got plenty of heat and humor to please even the most jaded romance reader. I can\'t wait to see what\'s coming up next for this wonderful new author! \n \"Yeah? You think so? You think you can handle me?\" \n Her eyes widen a little. \"I think so,\" she whispers. \n Then I let her slip from my arms, such a fucking shame, but I\'m not about to let her open her own door.

Ro and Jack are brought together by a terrible tragedy. Jack has been left bitter and empty; Ro is grief-stricken but still has the ability to laugh and relate to other human beings. I will admit I was a little reluctant to dive into this story, knowing it begins with a horrible event but I was immediately and completely captivated by these characters. \n \"I caught a glimpse of his soul. So many pieces of him had been fed to the lions. And as dark and bitter as it had turned him, he was a gladiator for standing where I would have surely fallen.\" \n The African backdrop is almost like another character in this book - harsh, stunning and dangerous. The descriptions of the land, its inhabitants and its wildlife are magical. I was literally lost in the pages of this story! Leylah Attar remains one of my favorite writers and I have devoured everything she has written. \'Mists of the Serengeti\' is a gorgeous and uplifting story filled with romance, love, life and tears.

Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite, living in a world of charity dinners, beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes. She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe, a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband, Henry. \n \"I stop protesting his indulgence, when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry. I stop looking for the catch. There doesn\'t seem to be one. So what do you do?\" \n But right from the beginning, there are cracks in Zoe\'s perfect life, and we don\'t know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life. She is growing bored as Henry\'s wife, and longs for her younger self, when she had a job, friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted. She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. \n \"I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person.\" \n Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really \"knew\" him at all. \n \"Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day.\" \n But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don\'t want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe\'s slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book! \n \'The Vanishing Year\' has been called a \"domestic thriller\". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end.

I can\'t wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti. \n Favorite quote: \n \"It wasn\'t that long ago that I found this sort of convenient arrangement of our lives to be charming, like a party card trick. A sleight of hand here, a simple misdirection there, and Voila, here\'s your dinner.

Hattie is the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend and friend. \n But Hattie has a secret life, one that threatens the delicate balance of her small Minnesota farming town. She is merely pretending, acting a role, when the \"real\" Hattie is far from perfect. Her actions will affect and change many people\'s lives forever. Peter is her high school English teacher who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. And Del is the lead investigator on Hattie\'s brutal murder. His voice lends a dry wit and careful reason to the series of events unfolding around him. Can he be neutral when the families he has known his whole life are brutally affected by this unspeakable crime? \n \"Mom warned me that I had a lot to learn about the world.

The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor. \n Lots of readers didn\'t like the jumping back and forth in time in the narration but I felt it added a sense of disorientation which was necessary in the book.

Daniels books, the hero and heroine and totally relatable and very \"real\". They have regular jobs, very good friends and and just came across as very down-to-earth. The secondary characters here were all wonderful: great supportive friends who stood by Brian and Sidney through everything! \n Brian was a fantastic, sexy, dirty-talking Alpha with a sweet and loving and sensitive side. He and Sidney have fantastic chemistry and I was rooting for them to make things work. I absolutely loved how Brian always tried to do the right thing and be the perfect man for Sidney. He made some terrible sacrifices and poor choices BUT he completely won me over with the way he treated Sidney! \n \'She couldn\'t know too much. She could never know. Never. I gave her enough so I could still have her, but I took everything.\' \n \'Four Letter Word\' was a wonderfully paced and steamy story, perfect for when you crave a sweet and sexy contemporary romance. J. Daniels is one of my go-to romance authors, and she really delivered with Brian and Sidney\'s story. I cannot wait for more stories in this series! \n \'Love was a risk. It was wild and unpredictable. You could either hold on for the ride, not knowing how it would end, or you could let go and never know the amazing you could\'ve had.\' \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.'),

I am in the minority on this one so read Retrieval for yourself and you might love it! I loved the scenes between Roman and Elisabeth and yes, they absolutely belong together! Their lives are intertwined with Walt and Clare. I adored Roman\'s sexy, uber-alpha ways. BUT there were too many inconsistencies in the story for me. The ending felt a bit rushed and I would have liked to have have spent more time with the main characters before the book ended. \n (view spoiler)[ For example, during their separation, Roman sent Elisabeth huge company checks for several hundred thousand dollars. You can\'t just write a check like that without accounting for it on a balance sheet or an accrual. It\'s not like writing a personal check! And she never cashed them, which would also raise some accounting red flags. But, okay. (hide spoiler)] \n The catchy plot will definitely please most readers and Roman and Elisabeth are something special. The book ends very abruptly and the second book with be about Clare and another character from Retrieval. Overall, this was a fast and mostly enjoyable book.'),

I really don\'t want to go into too much detail because spoiler-free is the way to go with this one! Fans of J.B. Salsbury know that she always creates THE most sensitive, damaged and protective heroes, but trust me, Lucas is VERY different from all her other characters. \n Lucas is trying to live a quiet and uneventful life, having lived through a terrible trauma. His daily struggles are painful and feel very real. Told in alternating POV\'s, the book also tells Shyann\'s story. She has come back home, not exactly willingly, in order to start over again while working for her dad. \'Split\' is not what you\'d expect from J.B. Salsbury but it is a wonderfully sensitive and VERY sexy story. With tons of suspense! \n Lucas is a beautifully damaged soul who deserves a happily ever after.

I devoured this confection of a story. I am absolutely floored that this was a debut novel! Every line was funnier than the one before. And the story was pure enjoyment! This book was the perfect antidote for me. \n Lucy and Josh are co-workers at a large publishing company who end up competing for the same job. I am very picky about office romances because (a) I work in an office, and (b) they are usually so unrealistic and overly simple. Not \'The Hating Game\'. The author nails the workplace setting perfectly. \n Lucy and Josh HATE each other. Like, they can\'t even stand to be in the same room together. But they share an office! They are complete opposites in every way. He is cold and controlling, she is warm and friendly. He is REALLY tall, she is VERY petite. They tease each other incessantly. \n \"Stop calling me Shortcake.\" \n \"Watching you pretend to hate that nickname is the best part of my day.\" \n The writing in this book was absolutely hilarious. The dialogue was fresh and original. \n \"I don\'t like big guys. They\'re too much like horses. They could trample you if you got underfoot. He is auditing my appearance with the same narrowed eyes that I am. I wonder what the top of my head looks like. I\'m sure he only fornicates with Amazons.\" \n Lucy and Josh eventually end of competing for the same job which would mean a huge promotion for both of them. Lucy comes to realize that their mutual and VERY public dislike for each other just might actually be mutual lust. She can\'t help but drool over Josh\'s perfection every single day. \n \"Today is a magnificent black T-shirt day. Write today in your diaries. Tell your grandchildren stories about it. I tear my eyes away, but they slide back moments later. Underneath that T-shirt is a body that could fog an elderly librarian\'s glasses.\" \n This book reminded me of \'Tangled\' by Emma Chase. The writing is smart, sexy, funny and very sharp. Both characters here are fully developed and the secondary characters are just as interesting! I fell in love with both Lucy\'s and Josh\'s families. AND I loved the characters\' growth over the course of the book. \n \"I\'ve got so much inside me I have no idea about. I\'m like the mayor of a city I\'ve never seen.\" \n I highly recommend this book if you are in the mood for a sweet and sexy modern romance with the perfect amount of wit and sarcasm. \n \"In the dark, I slide my body against his, feeling his sighs, and I tug him down to lie on me properly. \n \"I\'m pretty heavy.

The story revolved around a sexy pilot, Carter, who embarks on a romantic and unplanned adventure with Kendall, a girl who is running from her future. \n \'Playboy Pilot\' is a fast-paced, glamorous story that takes the reader to places around the world. It is a bit of escapist fantasy that is grounded in reality but is very funny, sexy, and enjoyable. \n Kendall and Carter meet in an airport when she is trying to decide what to do with the rest of her life. Carter is sexy as hell, a gorgeous pilot, and right then Kendall makes a rash decision that will change her life. Yes, Carter has had a wild past but he is completely honest with Kendall and does not try to hide his past. This is ultimately a very sweet romance, filled with lots of heart, written in the style that I love by these two authors. You can always count on a happy ending for the MC\'s in Penelope and Vi\'s books even if their path is not so smooth getting there.

As with the earlier books, all of the characters are inter-connected. Jensen is Hanna\'s bother and Pippa is Ruby\'s friend. They meet in the most adorable way on an international flight but of course neither one knows the who the other is. They meet up again and of course, sparks fly. These two could not be more opposite: Pippa is breaking free from her old life and is living \"in the moment\" for the first time in her life, and Jensen is a complete workaholic. But opposites attract, right? So while on a road trip, Pippa and Jensen start a wild fling. \n \"Your hair like this makes your eyes bluer,\" he continued, and my mind hit the brakes. \"Makes your lips pinker. Makes you look too perfect to be real.\" \n This is a fast-paced and endearing romantic comedy with an absolutely perfect Epilogue. I loved seeing the whole gang reunited again and enjoyed every minute of this book. Jensen and Pippa were fabulous together and the ending was exactly what I hoped for! \n \'It\'s too bad I\'m too eccentric for you. It\'s too bad you\'re too busy for me.

There was plenty of \"tell\" but not enough show. This lack of detail led to me not really feeling the bond between the main characters. \n Without spoiling the plot, there are just too many open questions in this book. The ending felt rushed. There are elements of romance, sex and even humor here, but I never \"felt\" the love between Evey and Lucian. I like that the author wrote a story that is certainly different and unexpected.

All of the ingredients for a great read! \n \"If you lie enough times, no one believes your truth.\" \n This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: no-nonsense, smart and engaging fiction. Helena is a very unlikely heroine, prickly, moody and basically angry at the world. She doesn\'t want to rely on anyone at all. She even keeps her long-time agent Kate at arm\'s length. \n \"On rare days, Kate regrets ever meeting the woman. But on most days, she just wonders about her. They say all geniuses are a little mad. Maybe Helena\'s madness just took longer to come out.\" \n But Helena as a story to tell and she doesn\'t have much time to do it. She sets her sights on one writer, and one writer only, to become her ghostwriter. A competing romance author, Marka writes books that Helena actually despises. But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story. \n \"What\'s happened to me? I have a story that I don\'t have time to tell. I have an empty house that reeks of death. I have no friends, no family, and no one to ask for help. I\'m dying, and it\'s the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.\" \n Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book, all while holding the reader\'s attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helena\'s life. This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs. \n \"You can tell them who you are, or what your job in the book was. I don\'t mind if they know I\'ve had help.\" \n They. The gods in their world, the eyes on which the axis rotated. The readers. The critics. What would they think? \n This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers. Helena\'s own story begins as a romance but you just know it is NOT going to conclude with a happily ever after. \n \"Boys like him don\'t go for girls like me, they don\'t follow me with their eyes, or listen when I speak. They don\'t lean closer or want more.\" \n I absolutely loved this book. Once I started I could not put it down. I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating. No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion, but this book is a total winner nonetheless. It is completely original and inventive. I have never read anything like it. Alessandra Torre deserves all the accolades for this one! \n \"Soon ... my final story will come out, and everyone will know the truth. \n (Reviewed from an ARC obtained from NetGalley.)'),

Even if you don\'t usually read this genre, DON\'T MISS DARK MATTER! It is a brilliant romantic suspense story that had me guessing until the very end. \n There IS a romance at the heart of this story of scientist/professor Jason Dessen, because to me, the struggle to get back to his beloved wife is what drives most of the action in this book. I went back and re-read the first chapter of this book after I finished to get a better picture of the sudden and violent kidnapping that occurs at the very beginning of this book. \n \"My life is great. It\'s just not exceptional. And there was a time when it could have been.\" \n \"You killed your ambition, didn\'t you?\" \n \"It died of natural causes. Of neglect.\" \n Jason is literally snatched from his current life and ends up in a place that might be a dream. He can\'t tell the difference between real-life and fantasy, until it slowly starts to dawn on him what is really happening to him. The author made me feel sad, nostalgic and thrilled all at once. Plus there is an ethical dilemma at the heart of this story. \n \"I feel insanity stalking me again, threatening to curl me up fetal and shatter me into a million pieces.\" \n Dark Matter is best read without knowing any spoilers. AND I was thrilled to learn that it is going to be made into a movie!! YES!! Paging Viggo Mortensen or Michael Fassbender! This story literally had me on the edge of seat the entire time I was reading. Just when I thought I had things figured out, I was surprised and thrilled by the next turn of events. Part philosophy about what might have been, part romance, and all suspense, Dark Matter is a book I won\'t soon forget. \n \"It\'s the beautiful thing about youth. \n There\'s a weightlessness that permeates everything because no damning choices have been made, no paths committed to, and the road forking out ahead is pure, unlimited potential.\" \n (With thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a review copy.)'),

You can read the synopsis for this story but it is best read not knowing more so I will try to keep this review spoiler-free. \'Scarlet Stone\' is funny, sexy, heartbreaking, emotional and very, very different.

(129, 19, 69, 4, '3.5 Stars \n I LOVED the premise of this book: a female motorcycle racer named Kenzie who races professionally. Her father was a legendary racer, and Kenzie is trying to carry on the family name. The racing scenes are fascinating and the story is very fast-paced. The author gives us an intimate, behind-the-scenes look into the highly competitive world of motorcycle racing. \n Racing is literally in Kenzie\'s blood. She is under tremendous pressure to succeed and her father is not her biggest fan. Hayden races for a competitor and he is strictly off-limits to Kenzie. She is downright mean to him at first, and they have a love-hate thing going on that was very intense. Kenzie has a lot of preconceived notions about Hayden which, of course, turn out to be completely wrong. Hayden is sex--on-wheels and he and Kenzie begin a Romeo-and-Juliet romance that must be kept hidden from everyone. \n Hayden is also an incredibly talented racer and Kenzie realizes she can learn a lot from him. They both actually race better when they are competing against each other. I absolutely love that the author created a female racer who is smart, strong and competitive in a traditionally male sport. Hayden is a DREAM and their scenes together are beautiful, sexxxxy and very believable. Overall, I really liked this book; it is a nice beach or poolside read and although some readers are not happy with the ending, I loved it!! There will definitely be more books to come in this series, and the next one sounds like it will be verrrry interesting!! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)');

Moody, evocative and thrilling, Lisa Jewell\'s writing surprised and enthralled me from beginning to end. \n This book begins with Alice, a frazzled single mother living in a tiny seaside town in England, finding a man, lost and alone and with no memory of how he came to be sitting on the beach in the driving rain. \n Alice is funny, warm, witty and has not made the best choices in her life. In fact, her love life stinks so she is very wary of men in general. But something calls to her about this lost and confused man, and she brings him back to her cottage to recuperate in her guest house. \n \"How long have you been sitting out here?\" \n \"I got here yesterday.\" \n \"Where did you come from?\" \n \"I have no idea.\" \n This brilliant story is told from multiple POV\'s spanning several decades. At the same time that Alice finds \"Frank\" (her nickname for the seemingly lovely man struggling with his memory loss), a young bride in London named Lily realizes her new husband has suddenly vanished. She is new to England and does not know anyone at all.

Their fascinating story involves a local man who becomes interested in Kirsty. Their stories rocket towards a stunning conclusion with Alice, Frank and Lily.

She made lots of mistakes in the past, and some of those mistakes might be coming back to haunt her now. \n Jake is PURE Alpha, a former SAS sniper who suffers from PTSD.

I will admit that it took me some time to get into this story, but once I did, I was engrossed in this very hot and at times very funny taboo romance. \n First, heed the warnings about this book and be aware that this story is VERY explicit! Ben and Naomi meet at a secret masked ball and immediately begin a passionate affair. Dr. Ben Beck is a philosophy professor who has written a book and has been invited to join the faculty at Yale. He has always questioned the existence of love and now ironically, now finds himself head over heels in love with the smart and beautiful Naomi. \n Once they become aware that Naomi is Ben\'s student, they are acutely aware of the risks they are taking. Naomi could lose her place at Yale andBen could lose his position on the faculty, at the very least. But this is actually a very fast-paced book and the author\'s brisk writing style and sense of humor make this a very readable story. \n \"Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.\" \n There are lots of things I loved about this book and some, not so much. I loved reading about Naomi\'s background and her family: she was raised by her father, a lobsterman in a New England town and she struggles to pay her way through college and to fit in at Yale. I would have loved to read more about Ben\'s background! The book is told in alternating POV\'s and the humor and brisk writing style lightens up the very explicit scenes. \n Naomi\'s character was unusually mature for her age. Although I did not have an issue with the age gap, I was not totally convinced what a 38-year-old would find so alluring and compelling about a college junior. I would have also loved to have known more about the \"secret society\" masked ball where Naomi and Ben first met. \n I loved Naomi\'s best friend Lucy and I know her story will be hilarious! This is certainly not your average student-teacher forbidden romance and for that, I applaud the author.

(134, 19, 84, 5, '\"I love you all the way.\" \n This is an EPIC story that was simply unputdownable, filled with characters that I will never, ever forget. The writing is outstanding! Nothing I can say in a review will do any justice to this gem but I will try. \n Certainly not a story for everyone, the book is at its heart a love story and what can happen when two human beings really, truly, deeply love each other and care for each other. Wavy and Kellen meet when she is just a young girl, but she is wise beyond her years, having suffered horrible emotional and physical abuse. Wavy has the misfortune to be the daughter of a meth dealer and a mentally-unstable mother. She learns young how to take care of herself and fly under the radar. \n There are lots of adults who drift in and out of her life and it is heartbreaking to see how misguided almost all of them are. From a well-meaning aunt to teachers who should know better, everyone basically fails Wavy and her little brother. Except for Kellen. \n \"He smelled good. Sweat and motorcycle and wintergreen. No stinking weed smoke. No perfume. No sadness. He smelled like love\" \n He is the one constant in her grim life, the one person she can always count on, no matter what. He provides her with shelter, clothing, all the basic needs that a parent should, plus love. I never viewed their relationship as odd, mostly because of the insightful points of view of the main characters. But for sure some readers will be uncomfortable with their age difference. \n The author\'s use of different narrators is brilliant. Especially sympathetic is Wavy\'s cousin, who is in awe of Wavy\'s wild ways. Wavy lives on and off with her aunt and cousins, but they really never know the depth and depravity of Wavy\'s unstable home life. \n \"Wavy in her black leather boots didn\'t fit in the catalog. She tore open the catalog and made surprising things happen. Like Ken in a dress.\" \n This book is the best book I\'ve read all year. I could not put it down. My favorite parts of the book are when the author Bryn Greenwood describes how painful it is for Wavy to speak. Words are almost real, tangible things for Wavy, that can be felt and tasted. Brilliant. \n This story spans many years and is filled with some of the most unforgettable characters that I have ever read. I absolutely loved how whip-smart Wavy was, and how she silently observed and took in everything around her. She is obsessed with the constellations and her sweet spot is gazing at the stars at night with her beloved Kellen. \n \"I liked learning things. How numbers worked together to explain the stars. How molecules made the world. All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years.\" \n Wavy never lost hope and pushed forward though life no matter how dire her circumstances were. My heart also broke for Kellen, a giant of a man who always treated Wavy with love and tenderness. They had a bond that was unbreakable. I can\'t think of anything more to say about this stunning book other than to please read it! It will change your life. \n \"I wanted a fairy tale ending for Wavy, because if she could find happiness, there would be hope for me, too.\"'),

She makes it her mission to find the man the letters were written to, and her search leads her to a small beachside town. The residents are a tight-knit group but Jessica, who had been restless in her professional and personal life, finally feels like she is \"home\". \n This is small-town romance at its best.

There\'s no unnecessary drama here, just a perfectly readable, hot romance with a fantastic cast of characters. Even if you\'re not a fan of sports romance, give this one a try. You will fall in LOVE with Brie Watson and Erik Winter! \n Favorite quote: \n \"She wanted to be someone\'s voice when they were beaten down, lost, forgotten--but now it was my turn to stand up for her. She deserved a better life and I wouldn\'t let myself rest until I gave it to her.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(138, 19, 26, 4, '4.5 Stars!! \n \"Don\'t focus on the what ifs. Focus on what is.\" \n Vi Keeland continues to shine in this very enjoyable and well-written office romance. I have loved Ms. Keeland\'s writing ever since I read her MMA Fighter series (Worth the Fight is a fantastic book and very underrated in my opinion). I am thrilled to see her show off her wonderful writing style with Bossman, a story that combines elements of humor, wit and the perfect amount of drama. Reese is the kind of heroine I love: smart, driven, a little sarcastic and very funny. She and Chase meet when she is stuck on a very bad date and he comes to her rescue. The whole situation is handled so perfectly! Chase is totally sexy and funny and charming, and surprise! It turns out that he is the founder of the company where she is starting a brand-new job. The company has a no-fraternization policy plus Reese has been burned by in the past when she slept with a co-worker. She has no intention of dating Chase, but he sure has fun pursuing her. \n Chase leaned over to me as we continued walking down the hall and whispered, \"Stop worrying. Harassment policy only applies to employees, not the owner. Checked this morning.\" \n I absolutely loved the slow-burn romance between Chase and Reese! Even though they do not fall into bed immediately, there is plenty of steam and genuine emotion when they do get together. She is scared of getting into a relationship with Chase because he is her boss\'s boss but Chase really cares for her and is impossible to resist. But just when you think everything will be perfect for these two, his past overcomes him and it seems as though he will never recover from the terrible trauma of an earlier relationship. \n \"Sometimes you don\'t know what you\'re missing until you find it\" \n I have to connect with the main characters to care at all about a story and I really connected with Reese and Chase. The book combined funny dialogue with some heavy emotion and it all just worked! I hope Vi Keeland writes more of these kinds of stories because they really show off her talent. I absolutely fell in love with Chase!! He\'s the total package and Reese\'s feelings for him just felt right. \n \"I\'m tired of looking back. It\'s been a long time since I\'ve wanted to live in the moment.\" \n If you are new to Vi Keeland, give Bossman a try! It\'s got the perfect combination of great chemistry, emotion, a sexy and damaged hero and witty banter. I read this book in almost one sitting and loved the conclusion to Reese and Chase\'s story. Bossman is another great story from Vi Keeland, surprisingly angsty with the perfect amount of steam!! \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.'),
(139, 19, 38, 4, '3.5 Stars \n If you like lots of high school drama, then this book is for you! Broken Prince reminded me of Gossip Girl in many ways. However, the over-the-top cruelty of Reed and Ella\'s fellow students here turned me off. The main characters have lots of promise, and I really loved Reed and Ella. Many readers love this series, so I am in the minority on this one and definitely pick this one up if you are in the mood for a guilty-pleasure read! \n \"He told me to stay away. He told me I didn\'t belong. If only I\'d listened to him.\" \n The first book ended on a major cliffhanger and in this second installment, former mean-boy Reed is desperate to find Ella. She has brought happiness and goodness to his royally-screwed up family and he will do anything to bring her home and win back her love. BUT there are SO many obstacles standing in their way! \n \"I can play this two ways. I can walk away. Or I can fight for you. Guess which one I\'m doing?\" \n This is very quick read and a very fast-paced story. The writing duo that makes up Erin Watt are incredibly talented, and I love their other books. If you know going in to Broken Prince that this is basically a teen soap-opera, then you will LOVE this juicy bit of fluff. But be warned: there is another cliffhanger! \n I did love reading Reed\'s POV in this book. I felt his pain and the pressure he was under to try and protect the innocent Ella at all costs. I also loved the VERRRRY sexy Royal brothers!! There was just way too much unnecessary over-the-top drama for me. But if you are looking for a summer pool or beach read, then pick up Broken Prince and enjoy the crazy ride! \n (ARC provided by the authors in return for an honest review.)'),

Cosway has such a beautiful way with words that is almost impossible NOT to fall in love with her characters! This series is highly rated but I haven\'t read the other books. This one is a complete standalone. Stu Cross stole my heart! \n This is a slow build romance and I absolutely loved the incredibly witty and sexy banter between the characters. Conway\'s writing is always a winner for me. This book has tons of heart, heat and sexy times! The chemistry between the characters was real and the contrast between Stu\'s toughness and Andie\'s sweetness was perfect. I read this book in one sitting and \'Thief of Hearts\' is one more reason why L.H. Cosway is an auto-buy author for me. Her writing flows perfectly and the characters are always memorable.

(141, 20, 47, 4, '4 - 4.5 STARS! \n Thrilling, sexy, second-chance contemporary sports romance with a twist. Somehow it all works in this perfect summer read! \n And they would fight to their end for me. This team was my family, my soul. And I think that was what made everything that happened so damn complicated. \n Tyler has grown up traveling with a baseball team her whole life. Baseball IS her life. She has been home-schooled, innocent, yet stunning and complete unaware of her effect on men. Then baseball\'s bad boy Chase Stern enters her life. A larger-than-life character, Alessandra Torre could have made him a cliche, but he is deeply sensitive, devoted to the game, and ready to give up his fast-living ways for Ty. \n Chase Stern. The best bat to hit our game since Barry Bonds. A shortstop who made Ripken look like a rookie. A body built for baseball, a face that made GQ editors swoon, and enough swagger to fill Dodger stands with females. \n Of course, Ty is forbidden to go near him, she is only 17 at the time and he plays for the team her father works for. But they fall deeply in love with each other, through stolen nights on the baseball field and living life on the road. She knows that he is completely off-limits, but these two share a deep bond that goes beyond the game of baseball. \n But it wasn\'t his looks that had sucked me in. It was his play. His effortless grip of a game that we all struggled with. His swing, his throw, the dip of his body when he scooped up a ball, the stretch of his six-foot body when he leapt in the air ... it was my porn. \n But then...the emotional one-two punch from the author hits and these two are suddenly, irrevocably separated . My heart broke for them!! Flash-forward several years and these two, now adults with their own lives, meet again. I absolutely LOVE second-chance romances, and MOONSHOT has everything I love about this trope. \n First loves were supposed to be flimsy and temperamental. They were supposed to burn bright and fade fast. They weren\'t supposed to stick. They weren\'t supposed to eat away at a man\'s heart, his capacity for life. \n Interwoven with this forbidden love story is a thriller aspect which slowly builds toward a terrifying conclusion. Ms. Torre is one of the few authors I know who can perfectly pull off such a clever post twist!! I was totally blindsided by this turn of events and it blended in perfectly with the story. It must be said that the author knows a LOT about the game of baseball and I loved reading about this part of the story, she has fabulous insight in to the game and I almost felt like I was in the stands ready for the players to take the field. MOONSHOT has everything I love about contemporary romance: deeply-felt characters; the sweetness of first love; very adult, steamy love scenes; and the bittersweet pain of second-chance romance. Please keep in mind that there is cheating in this book: this aspect of a story NEVER bothers me or affects my enjoyment of a novel but it is here in MOONSHOT plain and simple. Does it resolve itself? Absolutely. \n Alessandra Torre is an automatic one-click for me andI loved this story!! Happy reading! \n Favorite quote: \n Certain loves can\'t be fought. The harder you tried, the harder you would be knocked back, over and over again, until it beat you into submission, until your heart caved and body surrendered. Love like that didn\'t know the rules of society; it didn\'t care about life mistakes. It only knew what must be, and what would happen--no matter what. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(142, 20, 51, 4, 'Smoking hot conclusion to The Player!! Loved it. Filled with warmth, heat and plenty of angst. K. Bromberg is my go-to author for mature, emotional romances about real people dealing with real issues and facing them head-on. And \'The Catch\' delivered on all counts. \n I loved the in-depth look into the sport of baseball (but you do NOT need to be a fan of sports romances to love this story!) and the glimpse into the emotional highs and lows experienced by star athletes AND by their families and loved ones! The end of \'The Player\' was a whopper of a cliffhanger (I won\'t spoil it here!) and then BOOM! \'The Catch\' does a 180 degree turn! \n I appreciated Easton\'s POV here and as always, Ms. Bromberg created a male character with many dimensions. Easton is flawed, but he really puts himself out there and his HONESTY is what I loved most about him. Easton and Scout both grew as characters and their love, devotion to family and feelings for each other were absolutely spot-on.'),
(143, 20, 9, 4, '3.5 Stars \n The highly-anticipated third book in The Royals Series picks up right where the second book ended so the other books MUST be read in order! While overall I liked the teen-angst feel of this series, the third book felt a bit rushed at times and I felt that Ella and Reed lost some of the heat and passion that fueled the first two books. With that said, this writing duo is very talented and the wild storyline certainly held my interest. \n In \'Twisted Palace\', Ella is firmly in place as a member of the Royals household. Gone is the taunting and name-calling from the first book. Ella and Reed are now completely in love! \n \"Sometimes I still can\'t believe that we all hated each other when I first got here. Reed was determined to destroy me. His brothers alternately taunted or ignored me. I fantasized about running away on a daily basis. And now I can\'t imagine not having the Royals in my life.\" \n Reed has been arrested for the murder of Brooke and the evidence seems pretty strong against him. There are tons of questions in this book. Everyone at school is talking about Reed and giving damaging testimony against him. His past seems to catch up to him and his future looks very grim. Add to that is the fact that Steve is now back! There is TONS of drama plus wild plot twists in this book which makes \'Twisted Palace\' feel much more suspenseful than the first two books. I liked the forbidden-love aspect of the earlier books but this book adds almost a mystery element to the series. \n Reed is loyal to his core. He\'d die for his family. \n Hell, he might\'ve even killed for it. \n This series is great for readers who love over-the-top drama and first-love stories. I really liked the supporting characters and I hope some of them will get their own story! I also would LOVE a story about Callum Royal. While the brothers don\'t get as much focus here as in the earlier books, fans of this series will be happy to get more of Reed and Ella. Overall not my favorite in this series but still a fun, light, read that is a total guilty pleasure. \n (Reviewed from an ARC)'),
(144, 20, 97, 5, '\"It\'s about what\'s on the inside. Just like people. Don\'t you think? It\'s what\'s on the inside that really counts.\" \n A Gift of Time is a gift to the readers of the Nine Minutes series. The story flows beautifully through many different time frames, and back and forth between many different points of view. But it all works perfectly and the author has a BIG surprise waiting for fans of this series! \n I feel that A Gift of Time is, more than any other character\'s, Ginny\'s story. If you have read the first two books in the series (and you MUST before reading A Gift of Time), you know that Ginny has been through a lifetime of experiences and has had two great loves in her life. I have always loved both Grizz and Tommy, and I absolutely LOVED how the author resolves the famous Team Grizz/Team Grunt conflict here. This book is told in flashback so all the main characters make an appearance here, all leading toward a fascinating and satisfying conclusion. \n \"There were just some secrets we had to keep hidden in our hearts to shield those we love.\" \n It is impossible to describe the plot of A Gift of Time without giving anything away. This series is a creative, thrilling, imaginative, beautiful and ultimately uplifting story that I won\'t soon forget. Grrizz, Grunt and Kit will live on forever! Bravo, Ms. Flynn, for a fantastic conclusion to a terrific series. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(145, 20, 4, 4, '\"The dust has settled over the blood we\'ve shed.\" \n Non-stop action, plus tons of graphic violence, a feisty heroine and an ex-con with a soul!! BLOOD TO DUST features a kick-ass heroine, a damaged hero and a story that will have you saying, \"Did I just read that??\" I became a huge fan of LJ Shen\'s after reading SPARROW and could not wait to get my hands on Prescott and Beat\'s story. She is hell-bent on revenge on a group of men who are dangerous, corrupt members of a crime family. They have ruined her family, and committed terrible crimes against her. The only problem is that she is being held against her will by them. She is outnumbered and defenseless. And of her captors is Beat. \n Beat served time in prison with one of the men holding Prescott captive. He owes the a favor to one of the men, the sadistic and all-powerful Godfrey, and Beat (whose real name is Nate) just wants to fulfill his debt as soon as possible. Nate has committed murder in the past but he won\'t let any physical harm come to Prescott. As the captor and the captive spend more time together, Prescott and Nate begin to bond. Although he doesn\'t trust her at first (and rightfully so!), these two are kindred spirits who devise a plan to to repay their debts, seek vengeance and maybe, just maybe, find their own brand of happiness. \n \"We\'re polar opposites. He\'s peace looking for color and I\'m strorm looking for serenity.\" \n I love dark reads and I really liked this book (the author has a GREAT sense of humor) but felt the story spun out of control in some places. With that being said, Nate Vela is an unforgettable anti-hero!! Sensitive, strong, protective and damaged, I won\'t soon forget him. And Prescott is one of the strongest, most bad-ass heroines I have ever read. If you love a dark and gritty read, then you will love BLOOD TO DUST. I adore this author and can\'t wait to see what twisted story she comes up with next! \n \"Tell me something beautiful,\" his lips speak into mine. \n \"Us,\" I rasp. \"We\'re beautiful and ugly and broken...and whole.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

I couldn\'t put this one down!! I absolutely love enemies-to-lovers books, especially where there is an element of revenge. Plus, I adore Mia Sheridan\'s writing so I could not wait to read this book. And I will admit I do sometimes judge a book by its cover, and this cover is STUNNING. So there\'s that. \n I immediately connected with these beautifully flawed and damaged characters. Their pain, suffering, humiliation and pride broke my heart and Mia Sheridan put it back together again. While Lydia could have been a cookie-cutter, snobby heroine, she instead came across as loyal, loving and willing to admit to her past mistakes. And they were HUGE. A stupid and cruel act when she was a teenager led to a domino effect of tragic consequences for Brogan Ramsay and his family. And now he is back in Lydia\'s life, hell-bent on getting revenge for the pain she caused him all those years before. \n \"Learn from you mistakes, but don\'t let them define you now. Find forgiveness, for them and for yourself.\" \n Watching Lydia and Brogan slowly make their way back into each other\'s lives was painful, raw and breathtaking. So much drama and heartache separated these two that I lost thought they would never find their way back. There is an element of romantic suspense here which Mia Sheridan got just right. And the cast of supporting characters are all fabulous. (Fionn!! HELLO!!) Are there some pieces that don\'t quite fit together? Yes, but they are non-essential to the story and the characters are so strong that they swept me away. I was lost in this book and savored every minute of it. \n Brogan Ramsay had come from Ireland with his family and I loved how the author incorporated Gaelic throughout the book. What a beautiful and descriptive language! Ms. Sheridan\'s books always leave a lasting impression and Ramsay is no different. I am still thinking about the characters well after I finished this book. I fell in love with Ramsay Brogan and although he has\'t quite replaced Archer as my favorite Mia Sheridan hero, he comes close! Don\'t miss Ramsay, you will fall i love with these characters, too. \n \"There is such as thin veil between love and hate. I had chosen love.\"'),

This book is VERY different from the other books in the series!! I was so excited for Nan\'s book and to see how in the world the author was going to redeem this very unloveable, vengeful character. And she did it!! \n Nan has been the villain in this series, cold, spiteful and generally a bad person. The only person who ever seemed to care for her was her brother Rush. I devoured this book in one sitting daily because of Gannon. OMG is he hot!! There are two men vying for Nan\'s heart in this book and I was so glad I didn\'t read any spoilers. The author surprised me here with some very wild and explicit sex scenes. I also loved how Nan seemed to finally make peace with her family, especially with those she has been so cruel to in the past. And yes, Nanette does get her happy ending!!!

He doesn\'t know what to do or how to make things right again. He cannot live without Diana. \n \"The first time I saw her, I had to hold my breath.

Would I change my cellular structure? Turn my back on my identity? Walk away from it, never talk about it, burn it so thoroughly into a pile of dust that not telling her wouldn\'t be a lie? \n This raw and powerful book alternates between past and present so we really get a sense of the shared history between Adam and Diana. This story rockets towards a breathtaking conclusion as only CD Reiss can do. Her writing is crisp, clear, intelligent and very, very sensual. The depth of Adam\'s love for his wife is almost palpable and he will not let her walk away without a fight. And so she agrees to his detailed plan to spend 30 days alone together, away from their business in New York City. Adam is going to show Diana who he really is. The stakes are high but Adam plays to win. \n \"I can only breathe if I know she\'s there. I gave her my f*king soul and she threw it away. Months ago, maybe years ago.

I did NOT feel lost reading this book even though I had not read the first two books. Max and June/Olivia are two incredible characters , and the writing is crisp, clean, intense and INCREDIBLY sexy. \n June has a sister who is being held against her will by a cult. She dreams up a wild plan to rescue her which does not go according to plan and she ends up wounding and kidnapping Max, a dangerous MC President. Olivia is crazy about Max but he is a very dangerous man and can\'t be trusted. She brings him to her estranged aunt\'s house to recuperate from his wounds. The scenes in Florida at Aunt Fern\'s condo are priceless. And the slow burn starts to build between Olivia and Max, both damaged people who have led pretty sad and lonely lives. \n \"Mutual assured destruction. You and I have sex, get involved in that way...both us burn. Both of us. We\'ll tear each other apart until there\'s nothing left to walk away from.\" \n Olivia is a loner and doesn\'t dare dream of ever being happy. She makes sure to sabotage anything good that comes into her life. The story itself is gritty, somewhat dark and definitely NOT your typical contemporary romance. There is no insta-love, and it takes quite a while for those two to get together. This book is VERY steamy and includes a sexy F/F scene that is incredibly hot. But the action, the scenes between Max and Olivia and the swoony scenes that eventually happened between Max and Olivia were all absolutely perfect. There is a wonderful Epilogue and I loved the conclusion that Ms. O\'Keefe gave to these very troubled characters. \n \"Save your act for other people. The lies and the show - I don\'t want it.

Having read STEPBROTHER DEAREST, I could not WAIT to dive into this story. BUT even though that is one of my favorite books, and I highly recommend it, you do NOT have to read it first. \n Chelsea has been left completely brokenhearted by her ex, Elec. She thought he was the \"one\". He declared his devotion to her and she thought they would grow old together. But it was just not meant to be. Chelsea moves into a new apartment in a new neighborhood to escape the memories of her old life. At first it seems as though her HOT new neighbor Damien can\'t stand her, but then they begin to build a fantastic friendship that turns oh-so-slowly into a gorgeous romance. \n Damien is a brilliant artist who also happens to own the building where Chelsea lives. He has two Rottweilers who play a big part of this story and who are one of the reasons why Damien and Chelsea meet and get off to a rocky start to begin with. There\'s lots more to Damien then meets the eye, and learning about him is part of the wonderful experience of reading this book. \n Chelsea is extremely insecure after being suddenly dumped by Elec, and Damien\'s compliments and the way he sees her really help to boost her confidence. She is wildly attracted to Damien but he makes it clear she is in the friend-zone. But why can\'t they be more than just friends?? Has his heart been broken, too? What secret is he hiding?? \n \"I looked closer at what I\'d messaged him and realized it hadn\'t come through the way I\'d intended. the auto correct had actually changed the message to: Wanna duck?

And this series is one of my favorites, so I could not wait to get back into these characters\' lives! And what a treat! Once again, Ms. Douglas surprises and puts a fresh spin on her beloved characters. This book introduces us to Quinn, but also sets up the next generation of characters and it was just a pleasure to read. \n The author uses a story within a story here which added a layer of nuance and depth to what I thought would be a classic New Adult romance. Ms. Douglas gives us the backstory of Katherine Trent and Jason Caruthers and it broke my heart! Yes, you will absolutely need to read the other books in the series first but Bully and the later books are among my most cherished stories. From adult contemporary romance to new adult stories, Ms. Douglas can do it all. \n \"Why did you marry her?\" she asked me in return. \n I turned my eyes back out to the road as I would my way through her neighborhood. \n Because I didn\'t see you first. \n My heart!!

Secrets are revealed, inner desires unleashed with a heart-pounding romance at the heart of to all. \n Kai\'s story was incredible. Ms. Douglas is one of the most talented romance writers around and I just knew that she would create another romantic suspense story like no other. \'Hideaway\' is just as dark os \'Corrupt\' and will satisfy your every craving. Kai is an alpha like no other - dark, dangerous and SMART. \n \"We\'re only ever good, because there are consequences,\" I told her. \"Take those away, and everyone shows their true self. Kind of like taking off a mask.\" \n This book alternates back and forth between the present and Devil\'s Night six years before. Kai has finally met his match in Banks, a mysterious figure who may or may not have some connection to him. The chemistry between them is perfect, as I would expect with a Penelope Douglas book, but not instant. They have an intense and sexy connection but to say more would ruin the experience of reading this story. I am glad I did not know too much about the plot.

This book is definitely for fans of dark romance: this is not a hearts-and-flowers kind of book. But if you are a fan of the Four Horsemen from \'Corrupt\', then you will devour \'Hideaway\'! It is raw and gritty and WILD. And there is a fabulous sneak peek from \'Kill Switch\', Devil\'s Night #3. I can\'t wait to see how Ms. Douglas tells Damon\'s story!! \n \"This is what I wanted.

And LAST KISS does not disappoint. Laurelin Paige writes very adult, very sexy books and she kept me guessing throughout this whole story. Emily is insatiable for Reeve in this book and their chemistry burns up the pages. \n God, I was hungry for him. I roved my hands over his chest, wanting to touch all of his body at once, delighting at the hard muscles that met the underside of my palms. He was solid everywhere. A wall of strength and potency that could so easily overpower me. I was weak in his presence, incapable of anything except to yield. \n I loved Reeve Sallis from the beginning of this series (weird, I know!) and I adored his uber-Alpha ways. He obviously loves Emily but his loyalties are called into question here. There are tons of surprises in this book so I can\'t say anything about the plot in case you haven\'t read the first book in the series (which I HIGHLY recommend!!)

These are two adults who have lived through a lot and Emily might have finally found someone with who she can be completely herself. \n He leaned his hip against the vanity and folded his arms across his chest, a position that highlighted both his broad shoulders and toned biceps. \"You like it when I keep you guessing,\" he said dismissively, not an entirely inaccurate statement, though it was a bit discomforting that he knew it so well. \"And I like you on your toes,\" he added, his eyes dark as they slid the length of my body. \n LAST KISS is a super-sexy, romantic suspense that rockets toward a riveting conclusion. I could not put this book down!! Laurelin Paige is on my short list of must-read authors and she kept me on my toes throughout this whole book. The sexy times are TOTALLY hot, believable, adult and very raw. There are many characters that kept me second-guessing the plot and I certainly did not see this ending coming. Who was the bad guy? Was there even a bad guy in this story? You must read this book to find out!! \n A warning bell sounded in the back of my head, though, urging me to get my wits together and address . . . something. It was dificult to remember what exactly when his hands were on my breasts, squeezing and pinching. The bite of pain sent jolts of electricity through my nervous system, signals that my brain read as pleasure. Pleasure I couldn\'t resist. \n If you are a fan of sexy, suspenseful stories with an irresistible, Alpha male and a very strong heroine, then I highly recommend this series. You won\'t be able to put these books down! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)');

What would you do if the person you loved and thought was gone, suddenly re-appeared in your life, after you had moved on? This is the center of Taylor Jenkins Reid\'s fantastic new novel, ONE TRUE LOVES. From this powerful beginning, this story follows Emma as she must reconcile finding her long-lost first love with her new life and her new fiance, Sam. \n Emma and Jesse had been crazy in love and absolutely devoted to each other. They met as teenagers and ended up married and moving away from their small New England town to California. A tragic accident takes Jesse away, and after an agonizing period of mourning, Emma finds herself opening up to the possiblity of loving another man again. \n I think that perhaps everyone has a moment that splits their life in two. When you look back on your own timeline, there\'s a sharp spike somewhere along the way, some event that changed you, changed your life, more than the others. A moment that creates a \"before\" and an \"after.\" \n Told from Emma\'s POV, this book tells the story of how Emma and Jesse first fell in love. The author does an amazing job of creating very memorable characters who seemed very real. I felt like I knew Emma, Jesse and Sam and their friends and families. It is very important for me to feel connected to the main characters and I absolutely connected with all of the characters in this book. I loved how Emma grew and matured throughout this book and how her relationships with those around her changed and evolved as well. \n Good things don\'t wait until you\'re ready. Sometimes they come right before, when you\'re almost there. And I figured when that happens, you can let them pass by like a bus not meant for you. Or you can get ready. So I got ready. \n I cannot think of enough to say about this gorgeous book!! Emma, Jesse and Sam\'s story is so totally engrossing, you will feel like you are reading about your good friends. I cared deeply about what was going to happen to these three and was completely blown away by the direction this book took. This is a richly written, detailed story about first love, family, friendship and growing up. The ending is enormously satisfying and I found myself re-reading passages this book after I finished. I was not ready to say goodbye to these characters! ONE TRUE LOVES is certainly one of the best books of the year and one of new top favorite books ever. Don\'t miss this one!! \n Favorite quote: \n I don\'t think that true love means your only love. \n I think true love means loving truly. \n Loving purely. Loving wholly. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(155, 20, 85, 4, 'Ahhh, is there anything sweeter than second-chance love? I think not! K. Bromberg once again delivers with this sexy-sweet, second-chance love story with all new characters. The settings, the story, the characters...I simply fell in love with Hayes and Saylor!! \n The author is one of my top go-to contemporary romance authors and \'Sweet Cheeks\' is a perfect example of her easy, romantic and sexy writing style. \n Saylor recently called off her engagement and is shocked when she receives an invitation to her former fiancee\'s wedding. She is a smart, driven businesswoman who owns her own bakery. What is she to do? While not one to engage in unnecessary drama, she finds herself in an unusual \"situation\" after her assistant accidentally replies that she will be attending the wedding. With a guest! \n She is convinced to attend the destination wedding and to bring as her \"plus-1\" her old love, Hayes Whitely. Oh but guess what: he is now a Hollywood superstar, having abandoned Saylor years ago without a word when he left for Hollywood. Why on earth would she even consider this crazy idea?! But Hayes is VERY convincing and off they go to the tropics. A part of Saylor does want to show off to her ex, but she realizes that she could wind up getting her heart stomped on in a big way. \n Hayes may be a well-known actor, but Saylor was his true love. Can he ever make amends for what he did, and win back Sailor\'s trust? And love? \n Even at the age of seventeen, Hayes could kiss in a way that made me feel like I\'d just laid every part of my soul on the line when his lips left mine. \n If you are looking for a breezy, sexy, adult romance with a strong heroine and a sweet and sexy hero who just won\'t give up (and who happens to be the best friend of the heroine\'s brother!!), then \'Sweet Cheeks\' is for you! \n The way I see it , sometimes things happen in life and love\'s put on hold. But if someone\'s your soulmate, nothing is going to stop you from together in the end. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(156, 21, 84, 4, 'Well, well! The writing in \'The Deep End\' is VERY different from other Kristen Ashley books but not to fear, the author turns the heat WAY up in this book. I\'ll be honest, I had to think about this story for a while after I finished reading it. \n I loved the plot of this book. The heroine Amelia is a Domme and is very accepting of herself and her needs. She was unapologetic about her lifestyle and for that, I applaud the author. In many other ways, she was just a normal human being with a desire to build a relationship with someone outside the BDSM scene and club life. \n Amelia is a member of the ultra-exclusive club The Bee\'s Honey. They have a very rigorous screening process and she knows the men she will meet will have to pass certain requirements before they can walk in the door. She has never quite met the \"perfect\" sub but once she sets her sights on Olivier, all bets are off. He\'s her dream man, an Alpha sub who can meet her every need. He is everything I love about a KA hero: strong, confident, loving and caring. I had a bit of difficulty with their dynamic because he didn\'t seem like he was really a true submissive but their relationship worked. Olivier and Amelie didn\'t have a \"typical\" D/s relationship (if there even is such a thing) but they both seemed perfect for each other. \n I am a diehard Kristen Ashley fan so I will read anything this woman writes. I LOVED the erotic aspects of this story and the BDSM scenes did not offend me at all. I think that KA writes some very explicit sex scenes but \'The Deep End\' is VERY explicit!! If you are a fan of this author\'s books, then definitely give this one a try. It is different and intriguing and has some very unique characters. Just be prepared to be surprised. Enjoy!! \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.'),
(157, 21, 92, 5, '4.5 - 5 STARS \n \"How long does it take to fall in love? A second? A week? A year? It\'s like asking how long it takes to fall asleep. Some people are gone as soon as their head hits the pillow. Others lie awake for hours, and it\'s only when their brain stops churning for a while that sleep sneaks in and drags them under. That\'s how I visualize people falling in love. Some people fall so easily, they seem reckless. They love freely and unashamed. Those people are idiots. Or at least I used to think so. Until now.\" \n GAH!!! MY HEART!! Wicked Heart is the story of Elissa (who is Ethan\'s sister from Bad Romeo & Broken Juliet). One night, she happens to run into Liam Quinn, and he steals her heart. But fate has other plans for these two, and sadly, Elissa finds herself without Liam, and clueless as to why he disappeared from her life. Flash-forward years later and Elissa and Liam are working on the same stage production. Excerpt now, Liam is a superstar and has an equally famous fiance. \n Elissa is a professional and as stage manager, she is not allowed to become involved with any to the actors on the production. Liam broke her heart years before and she is trying her best not to let his new relationship crush her again. Liam still cares about her but being \"just friends\" with him might be too painful for her already fragile heart. \n \"Friends\" is one of those terms that seems benign but has a whole host of barbed-wire boundaries. Once you\'ve made love to someone with so much passion that his name is branded on all your cells, is it possible to ever think of him as just a friend? Or is the heat of on old flame always going to lie dormant, just waiting to consume you again?\" \n But just you don\'t think this book is all angst, Leisa Rayven writes incredibly witty and funny dialogue to lighten up the mood. I found myself swooning, laughing AND crying while reading Wicked Heart!! \n A shudder of pleasure runs up my spine. \"Oh, I wouldn\'t dream of destroying such perfection. Are those hospital corners?\" \"If you find that sexy, then yes.\" I let out a soft groan. \"Such a turn-on.\" He chuckles, thinking I\'m teasing, but I\'m really not. I\'m a self-confessed neat freak, and knowing he keeps a tidy house makes me all kinds of hot. \"Well, if you\'re finished eye-fucking my bed,\" he says, \"I have something else to show you.\" \"If it\'s a recently cleaned bathroom, I don\'t think my body\'s ready.\" \n This book is filled with sexual tension, heat, humor and heartache. The author\'s writing is so beautiful that I was swept away while reading this book. While I recommend reading the fantastic Bad Romeo and Broken Juliet before reading Wicked Heart, it is not necessary in order to enjoy this story. Oh and did I mention that I LOVE Liam?

(158, 22, 15, 4, '4 - 4.5 Stars! \n Sexy, sweet, and heartwarming with some very witty moments. My first Lex Martin book and I loved it! You can absolutely read Shameless as a standalone, even though Brady appeared in Finding Dandelion. Shameless has heart, characters I connected with and wonderful supporting characters. Brady is a tattoo artist who happens to have a Fine Arts degree and also rides a Harley. He travels from Boston to his brother\'s farm in Texas after a sudden tragedy to take over the care of his baby niece. I was already swooning before I even got to the baby part. \n \"Here is this hot man, tattoos decorating his rugged arms, muscles tugging at the fabric, asking me about the baby\'s binkie while he holds her close to his chest.\" \n Katherine is helping with the care of the baby and staying on the farm after the sudden loss of her best friend. She is nerdy but beautiful and sweet and Brady is very attracted to her. He is drawn to her kindness and devotion to the baby and the farm. And when he learns about her background...well, his heart and my heart broke for her! She had a very tough childhood but attended college on a full scholarship. She is hard-working and humble but Brady thinks they can never be in a committed relationship. He needs to go back to Boston and Katherine has roots in Texas . Plus they are both dealing with loads of grief and guilt. Not the best time to fall in love. \n It is very hard for a writer to create a connection between her characters and the reader but Lex Martin has done an outstanding job with this in Shameless. I really cared about Katherine and Brady and what would happen to their new \"family\" and to blossoming their relationship. Shameless is swoony and passionate and funny and sexy, with the added bonus of the fantastic Texas Hill Country setting. \n This was a solid romantic read for me, with all the right elements. Brady was tender, sexy, and hot; Katherine was funny, smart, sexy and strong. I am still thinking about these characters days after finishing the book, which is always a good sign for me. I can\'t wait to go through my Kindle and read Lex martin\'s other books! \n Favorite quote: \n \"When you find your own little slice of heaven on Earth, you do everything you can to preserve it.

(159, 23, 88, 4, 'Raine Miller has written another swoony, sexy, and beautiful story!! I fell in LOVE with Caleb! \n I couldn\'t wait to read this new series from Raine Miller. Loosely connected to the Blackstone Affair series, the new Blackstone Dynasty introduces Caleb Blackstone, a wealthy businessman who is handsome, brilliant, driven, and of course, all alone. His life is filled with one-night stands and no permanence. He neither has the time or the interest in a lasting relationship. His family is wealthy and he does seems to have it all. Raine Miller writes an Alpha male like nobody\'s business and you can add Caleb Balckstone to the short list of handsome, passionate heroes. \n Yes, there is some insta-love here BUT Raine Miller is a masterful writer and takes time to build her characters. When Caleb first sees the pretty Brooke, he smitten. Their later chance encounter at a party leaves a lasting impression on him. Little does he know that their families actually share a long history together. But Brooke, who is working several jobs, has ZERO interest in a serious relationship. She has suffered great loss in her life and was forced to leave her home England at a young age to live with her grandmother in America. Caleb and Brooke are both totally blind-sided by their mutual attraction. \n \"Nothing was familiar when it came to Brooke. Each new thing we shared together felt to me as if I\'d never done it before, and more importantly, as if I never wanted to do it again with anyone other than her--ever.\" \n I loved how Ms. Miller touched on the loneliness that both of her main characters felt. It was very poignant and made Caleb and Brooke\'s growing relationship all the more sweeter. I also adored how devoted Caleb was to Brooke and their passion together was INCREDIBLE! If you are looking for a beautifully written contemporary romance that is fairly low on the drama and angst, then \'Filthy Rich\' is for you. The author made the New England setting come alive for me and I absolutely ADORE the cover of this book. The cover model Adam Cowie is THE perfect Caleb Blackstone. \n While this book is a standalone, there will be another book coming in this series in February of 2017 for more about the Blackstone family! \n \"When you find whatever it is that makes you happy, Caleb, hold on to it with everything you\'ve got.

Gage and Tinker\'s story was a hot and sweet slow burn romance, with the perfect amount of humor, depth and emotion. \n I read a lot of MC stories and Joanna Wylde remains one of the best writers in this genre. The Reapers is one of my favorite MC series and I knew from the first few pages that this would be an exciting, witty and sexy story. \n Gage is above all else loyal to his club. He hates his current undercover assignment, mainly because he has a fake girlfriend which is stopping him from claiming the stunning Tinker. The Club always comes before all else. \n \"Reapers forever, forever Reapers. \n Sometimes loyalty sucks.\" \n Tinker Garrett is certainly not Gage\'s usual \"type\" - she is smart, runs a thriving business, owns her own home and is taking care of her elderly father. Not the usual young girls Gage toys with. And I absolutely adored Tinker\'s best friend!! But Gage soon realizes he could have something real and beautiful with Tinker and he sets out to claim what\'s his. \n I turned, catching the back of her head and pulling her in for a hard kiss, because fuck loyalty. \n There is a lot going on in this book plot-wise, no question. But Ms. Wylde ties everything together AND really makes you CARE about the main characters. As always, the Washington State setting is perfect and well-researched. And can we talk about the ending and the fantastic Epilogue?? Both surprisingly sweet and sentimental, they added another level of emotional depth to an already great story. \n REAPER\'S FIRE is another fantastic, sexy and totally engrossing story from the talented Joanna Wylde. \n \"When you look back at this moment, I want you to remember there was a BEFORE I claimed you and an AFTER.

Ann has become my new favorite author!! I DEVOURED the Jack & Jill Series, and One features two characters from that series. Although this book can technically be read as a standalone, PLEASE PLEASE read the unforgettable books in the Jack & Jill Series first because there are some major spoilers. The author calls this genre Romantic Comedy but it so much more! Swoony romance, funny dialogue, dramatic moments and SEXY scenes...Cage and Lake are two very memorable characters. \n Lake became an amputee after a tragic car accident that took the life of her fiancee. She has moved away from her family in California to Minneapolis, where she once again runs into the football star Cage, with whom she once shared an unforgettable kiss. She cat get Cage out of her head and cant believe he remembers her, too. Cage really sees Lake, not her disability, and she can\'t get him out of head. \n \"Mind if I lose the leg?\" I asked. \n He shook his head. There really were no words to describe how his lack of any sort of reaction made me feel. \n Not one flinch. \n Not one nervous glance at my leg. \n Not one second of hesitation. \n Cage is sexy, warm and loving. He falls fast for Lake, who is impulsive, funny, a little insecure and very, very honest. She makes a living by testing artificial limbs, and her work takes her all over the world. A trip to China provides one of the BEST scenes in the whole book!! It is so hard to categorize any of Jewel E. Ann\'s books, they really cover all the bases and I ended up highlighting half this book. \n \"My mouth said thank you, but my heart said I love you.\" \n Lake is quickly thrust into the world of NFL pro football and things aren\'t always easy. Her family makes an appearance in this book and they are always there to support her. There are some very dramatic moments in this book which provided some very unexpected and very surprising twists, as only this author can do. The supporting characters are, as always, absolutely fantastic (Flint! Hello!! Would love to read your story!!) Warm, sexy and laugh-out-loud funny, ONE is another home run from this amazing author. \n \"Give me you. Give me every tear. Give me every breath. Give me every fear. Give me every touch.

I am calling \'Twist\' a friends-to-lovers story because Alex meets her ideal man online and they really do become \"friends\" even though it is through a dating site. She decides to surprise him and travels all the way to Coeur d\'Alene, Idaho. SURPRISE! It turns out she was not communicating with \"Eric\" but instead was really emailing with Joe, his brother. A big, sexy, lumbersexual brother. Not her type at all. Oh no. \n \"With all the body-shaping underwear, lip gloss, heels, and tiny dress, you could almost say I\'d been fibbing about who I was. His lie, however , left my Spanx and push-up bra way behind.\" \n Joe is beyond shocked to see Alex in person and her already-fragile ego takes a nose dive. One thing leads to another, and Alex decides to stay in town and realizes that Eric is actually not her type at all. It is Joe is the one who she really developed the relationship with. In all his bearded, muscled glory. Kylie Scott is a truly gifted writer and the banter banter between her characters is priceless. While we all know this story will have a happy ending, it is the journey there that is so satisfying. Alex is a real, relatable and very funny heroine, and the scenes between her and Joe are GOLD. \n \"No more hiding or denying, sticking to the sidelines of life. It was my time to step forward and be brave. When it came to Joe Collins, I was more than ready to say yes.\" \n Alex is hilarious and warm and real and someone you would want as your best friend. The whole gang from the Dive Bar series is here plus my favorites from the Stage Dive series. BUT with that said, this is a complete standalone and you do not need to have read any of the earlier books. \n \'Twist\' had plenty of steamy hot scenes and I think Joe Collins might be one of my favorite Kylie Scott characters. Joe and Alex have amazing chemistry and there is just enough angst to add the perfect amount of tension to this romance story. And all the kudos to Kylie Scott for writing a STRONG female heroine who goes after what she wants!! YES!! This is a funny, sexxxxxy, well-written and lighthearted romantic comedy. It has the perfect mix of dirty, laugh-out-loud humor and well-rounded characters.

His body was one big beautiful playground.

Set in the South, Ginger\'s Heart is a contemporary romance and a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood. The story follows Ginger, Cain and Woodman, who have known each other their whole lives. Ginger has always loved bad-boy Cain, while his cousin, Woodman, has been in love with Ginger since she was a young girl. \n Cain knows he can\'t have Ginger, he is loyal to his cousin and he stays away from Ginger. Both boys enlist in the military and the story follows the three of the through the years. I love a good love triangle and even if you are not a fan, the way Katy Regency is beautiful and passionate and emotional. It is easy to see why Ginger could not really choose between Cain and Woodman. \n Cain is the one who play the \"wolf\" role in this story, he has a good heart but he has never lived up to his family\'s expectations for him. He is sexy, wild and irresistible. But he is fiercely loyal to his cousin and he treats Ginger like a princess. \n \"He was uncouth, bad mannered, irreverent, impertinent, and irresponsible, with a mouth like a sailor before he\'d become a sailor, and a dick that had seen so much indiscriminate action, it\'s a wonder it still worked.\" \n Everyone exited Ginger to spend the rest of her life with Woodman. He is devoted to Ginger and she loves him but not the same way that she loves Cain. I really liked Woodman and was rooting for Ginger to love him! This book takes a very surprising turn near the end which I did not see coming. I absolutely loved the span of years in this book and loved watching Ginger grow up. Katy Regency makes both Cain and Woodman very sympathetic characters and the story is romantic, sexy and very emotional in some parts. \n \"It doesn\'t make one of us a villain and one of us a hero. You can\'t help who you love. But someone\'s heart was goin\' to break.\" \n This is a very engaging and lovely story with a very creative twist.

There\'s a little bit of sex but mostly this is a sweeping romance novel, much like Dynasty and Dallas from the 1980\'s. If you loved those series, you will love this book. There\'s betrayal, unrequited love, family fortunes, and much scheming. \n There are many characters to love here and many to hate. Some are over-the-top but I loved the central storyline involving Lane and Lizzie. \n The author really gets the Southern mannerisms right, and the backdrop of the Kentucky Bourbon industry is fascinating.

The kiss that proved that a long-haired brooding boy from Norway and a quirky girl from the Deep South could find a love to rival the greats. \n Hopefully you haven\'t read any spoilers for this book because I will say that the ending COMPLETELY surprised me! These two completely and totally loved each other from the time they were children. They were inseparable. Then Rune suddenly has to move away with his family, but the worst heartbreak was that Poppy cut him off with no explanation. His heart was broken. But that\'s not even the sad part of the book. Rune returns several years later but he is different, changed, all because of what he suffered through. \n Poppy is devastated to realize that her treatment of Rune is what caused him to become moody and cold towards her. When she finally tells him the truth about why she cut him off, he becomes totally devoted to her. Please listen to the author\'s own description of this book as a \"tearjerker\"! Because that\'s what it is. I loved Rune\'s absolute devotion to Poppy and her strength and bravery was beautiful. \n This is an extremely emotional book but yet the story and the characters are incredibly engaging.

Throw in a sexy British swimming superstar and a funny, beautiful, and driven soccer player, and I\'m all in. \n The Summer Games is definitely NOT just for fans of sports romance. This story is addictive, fun, enjoyable and very, very funny. R.S. Grey\'s one-liners are absolutely hilarious. Andie is a champion women\'s soccer player, in Rio for the Olympic games. She\'s young, fit, focused on the competition but ready to let loose in the Olympic Village. \n \"I had to keep up my workouts and diet. Sure, I\'d nearly chugged a bottle of vodka the day before, but sometimes vodka counts as medicine.\" \n Of course she was warned to stay away from bad-boy British swim champion Freddie Archibald, but Andie is just what Freddie needed in his life. He is promised to another woman, an uptight social climber to whom appearances are everything. Caroline is the opposite of Andie and Freddie has no intention of continuing with their sham \"engagement.\" \n R.S. Grey really brings in on in the romance department in this book. This is is MUCH sexier than some of her other books and I absolutely ADORED it!!! Andie and Freddie are incredible together. But will their romance continue after they have both left the Summer Games behind? \n \"I needed her more than I needed my next race. The water was soothing, but Andie lit me on fire.\" \n I loved how strong and competitive Andie was and how she stayed laser-focused on her team and the games. And I always love a dual POV - and R.S.

I highly recommend The Summer Games, it is completely addictive! I can\'t wait for the next book in this series!! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Each moment is a story in itself.\" \n Swear on This Life is one of THE best second-chance romances I\'ve ever read. This book is perfection!!! \n I really can\'t do justice to this beautiful and heart-wrenching story. This is one of those books that absolutely must be experienced by reading the author\'s own perfectly-crafted words. Swear on This Life is incredibly imaginative, creative and heart-stopping, and is one of my favorite books this year. \n I finished this book months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. It is a book I have been telling all my non-bookish co-workers and friends to read. I completely tuned out the world when I read this book and wanted to spend every waking minute reading it. The past and present blend together seamlessly in this book and there are flashbacks within flashbacks. This could be confusing BUT Renee Carlino does it brilliantly here. There are really 4 main characters in this book: \"real-life\" Emiline and Jace, and \"fictional\" Emerson and Jackson. The early days of the real main characters and the fictional characters are absolutely harrowing. Emiline has now escaped her past and grown up to make a perfectly nice life for herself. She struggles, however, to find her voice as a writer. She has tried her best to put her painful past behind her, but reading the popular best-selling book featuring Emerson and Jackson has brought her childhood crashing into her present-day self in a way she is not quite ready to face. \n \"Most of the time people who are lost don\'t ever find their way back.\" \n I like to be challenged as a reader and Swear on This Life did just that. It is a fascinating and unique second-chance romance like none other. At times excruciatingly painful and brutally honest, the book is also romance and women\'s fiction at it\'s very best. There is actually some humor to lighten up the overall heavy tone of the book along with an intensely sweet first love story. Emotional and satisfying, Swear on This Life is a must-read. \n \"Some of us will look back on our lives and recall events that were a bit too perfect, but until you know the whole story, it\'s impossible to see the universe at work, or even admit that there is something bigger than us, making sure everything that should happen does happen.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(170, 23, 78, 5, 'Original, fresh, fast-paced, sexy.... LOVED every word of this book!! \n L.J. Shen has written an incredibly thrilling and amazingly satsifying book. I love her writing style and can\'t wait to read her other books. This story grabbed me by the throat from the first word and didn\'t let go until the very last page. And what a beginning! Sparrow has found herself in a sudden arranged marriage to one of Boston\'s most notorious criminals, Troy Brennan. \n He has a troubled past. A disastrous future. And I\'m about to become a part of his present, whether I like it or not. \n Sexy, dangerous, with not one ounce of kindess or compassion, Troy is a feared and legendary figure in Boston\'s crime circles. Sparrow has known of him all of her life, having grown up on the mean streets of Boston and with a father who was a low-level member of one of Troy\'s father gangs. Sparrow has no clue why she has been forced into this marriage because Troy seems to hate her as much as she hates him, and they both seem revolted by the idea of being married to each other. \n \"Dear future wife...\" He smirked in a way that made me want to beg for mercy. \"If you think you\'re going to give me trouble, think again. I invented trouble. I stir it, I mix it, I fucking fix it. Don\'t try my patience, because you\'ll discover I have absolutely none. \n Sparrow is feisty, resilient, smart and yes, very innocent and sheltered in many ways. She has no qualms about standing up to Troy, and he actually likes it. Sparrow is different from all the gold-digging women who are only interested in his wealth and his power. He actually kind of likes her, in his own, sick, very twisted way. But Sparrow learns quickly how to survive in her gilded cage and is thrilled when Troy agrees to let her work in one of his restaurants. \n The sexual chemistry in this book is explosive!! Troy is the ulimtate bad boy. But what makes this book so unique is the witty sarcasm from both her main characters and the crsip and snappy dialogue. I read this book in almost one sitting and I still want more!! \n \"I was in love with a murderer who didn\'t love me back, who never explained why he took me for his wife. It wasn\'t fine, wasn\'t okay, but it was the ugly, embarrassing, uncomfortable truth. Considering how fucked up my truth was, I began to understand why Troy gave me something far more convenient and beautiful. He gave me lies, and I ate them from the palm of his hand. He gave me lies, and for him, I closed my eyes. \n This book rockets forward at a breakneck speed, with an incredible storyline that kept me guessing until the very end. There are many memorable supporting characters but Troy and Sparrow are the main focus and i kept hoping that Troy wasn\'t really as evil as he seemed to be. Sparrow is no pushover and I absolutely adored the ending that author gave these two. This book is one of my favorite books so far this year and it is defintely the most original. I highly recommend this story and can\'t wait to read more from this author! \n FAVORITE QUOTE: \n \"Failure is inevitable,\" he continued in a flat tone that didn\'t hold much emotion or hope, \"and heartache is unstoppable. One day, I\'ll forget to clip your wings. When that day arrives, when you run away, I guess I\'d be happy to know you\'ll still have some money and the means to make it in this wild, tough world.\"'),

Mariana Zapata creates incredibly REAL characters with real fears, disapppintments and dreams. Everything you\'ve heard about this author is true. She takes her sweet time to build a connection between her MC\'s so that when they get to their HEA, it feels RIGHT. \n \"I would have done just about anything for you back then, even when you got on my nerves. I might have just waited until the last minute to push you out of oncoming traffic, but I\'d still push you out of the way.\" \n That\'s what I\'m talking about!

Do NOT let the title scare you away! The Ending I Want is a very positive story in many ways, even though the plot is pretty much revealed early on in the book. Samantha Towle is such a capable writer that this story could have turned into a tired cliche. Instead, it is an exciting, fast-paced, immensely enjoyable book with two very memorable main characters. \n Can we talk about Liam? At first I thought, \"Oh no, not another wealthy British businessman!\" But he is warm, smart, sensitive and ALPHA all rolled up into one perfect package. The problem is that Taylor Shaw only has plans to visit England for two very short weeks. Which means that she might have to tell Liam about the secret that she is trying not-so-successly to hide from him. \n \"I would have stayed because I\'m pretty sure I was in love with you from the moment you surprise-kissed me on the plane. You had me instantly.\" \n The Ending I Want is not overly-sentimental or sappy. Instead it is the perfect mix of humor, hope and love. I absolutely loved this unexpectedly beautiful story. Oh, and The Mighty Storm fans - watch for an appearance by Jake Wethers!! \n Favorite Quote: \n \"I\'m smiling and laughing and doing something that scares the crap out of me. I\'m living because of Liam. And that thought alone brings with it a whole new brand of fear in me. A fear that terrifies me in a way that I have never known before.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(173, 23, 19, 5, 'Just, WOW. My first Kim Jones book and it absolutely BLEW ME AWAY! Sinners Creed excited me, stunned me, shocked me and yes, even made me cry. Which is not an easy feat. Even if you\'ve read a lot of MC books, this book will surprise you and thrill you and I can\'t recommend it highly enough. \n This is an unwavering, no-holds-barred look into club life, with all of the violence, sex and raw emotion you can imagine. Brotherhood comes before all else, and these men will sacrifice everything for their brothers. Dirk is no exception: he has become a notorious enforcer, a nomad, who travels wherever Club business takes him, always alone, always doing what needs to be done, no matter what the price. \n Saylor comes into his life quite by accident, and gradually, slowly, they develop a deep and loving bond. Dirk has lived a sad, brutal life, and Saylor finally is something good in his life. Saylor is running from something, and Dirk agrees to take her on his travels across the country. \n It is best if you go into this book without knowing too much detail about the plot. I knew nothing about this book when I started reading it. It turns out that Saylor loves to ride, and really, she is the only joyful part of Dirk\'s violent existence. This book took a very surprising turn which was perfect for these two characters. Some will love it, some will not, but take a chance on Sinner\'s Creed and go on the Dirk and Saylor\'s journey with them. This book was magical, gritty, raw and beautiful all at once. \n Read an excerpt at www.thebookbellas.com \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(174, 24, 48, 4, '3.5 -4 ADDICTIVE STARS \n This place is like the Garden of Eden. Beautiful but full of danger. \n There was SO much to love about this book! Ella, the feisty, smart and sarcastic survivor. The sex, lust, and dirty talk. The fast-moving storyline. I really liked this book a lot but the over-the-top teen drama, the cruelty and the unecessary theatrics got in the way from making this a homerun for me. \n Elle Kennedy and Jen Frederick (the pair behind Erin Watt) are amazingly talented and gifted writers. Their writing talent made this book a TOTAL guilty pleasure, with a very likeable and resilient heroine and TONS of hot and heavy lust and sex. Ella Harper finds herself suddenly living in a world of almost unimaginable wealth and privilege after Callum Royal, her father\'s old friend, becomes her legal guardian. She is a poor girl who did what she had to support herself and get through high school. Suddenly, she is enrolled in private school and living in a house filled with Callum\'s sons, who are resentful of her, to say the least. They are on a mission to destroy her, and to make her leave. Despite their taunts and their endless bullying, she refuses to leave and is only after one thing: to finish high school and go to college. \n \"You should get away from here. These Royals will ruin you.\" \n Oh but there\'s the little detail of Reed Royal. The meanest of them all (and that\'s saying a lot), he and Ella hate each other at first sight but then can\'t stay away from each other. Even though I disliked Reed at the beginning, he began to grow on me and I could see how Ella eventually found him irresistible: \n \"He has everything a girl could want: the hard body, the handsome face that will still look good years from now, the money, and that extra something. Charisma, I guess. The ability to slay you with a single look. The apple is dangling in front of me, juicy red and delicious, but, like the fairy tale, Reed Royal is the villain disguised as a pretty prince. Taking a bite out of him would be a huge mistake. \n The Royals run the school and everyone there follows their orders. This book reminded me a lot of Beverly Hills 90210 and Gossip Girl. There is no question that this story is unputdownable. I just would have liked less cruelty and a little more reality. Nonetheless, I will most DEFINITELY read the next book because this one ends on quite the cliffhanger! I really do want to see what is next for Ella Harper. \n \"Auden wrote that when the boy falls from the sky after calamity after calamity, he still has a future somewhere and that there\'s no point in dwelling on one\'s loss. But did he suffer this? Would he have written that if he had lived my life? \n (ARC provided by the authors in return for an honest review.)'),
(175, 24, 48, 5, '5 fighting stars!! \n \"I\'ll fight for us, but I\'ll need you to fight too.\" \n JB Salsbury has written a classic friends-to-lovers story, with two characters that I loved from her previous books. Killian and Axelle have been best friends since childhood, but Kill is not your typical bad-boy MMA fighter. He\'s a nerd in high school, and worships Axelle from afar. He thinks she could never be interested in someone like him, a geek who wears glasses, quiet and nerdy. Axelle, who has bad terrible choices in men, secretly loves him, but she doesn\'t feel worthy enough for the smart, driven Killian. \n There is more emotion, sexual tension and heartbreak packed into this book then many books twice the size. I could not put this book down and this story touched me on so many levels that I am still thinking about it a week after finishing! I fell in love with Killian. He is now my favorite of all the Fighting boys. Sweet, sexy, protective, strong, gentle - he is the TOTAL package. \n And Axelle is a fantastic heroine, she makes bad choices, is far from perfect but picks herself up and moves on and makes a better life for herself. She realizes early on that she can\'t hold Killian back from a stellar fighting career and refuses to hold him back. \n \"I can\'t lose him to someone else. But I can\'t allow him to pass up on a chance at happiness with someone else either.\" \n Axelle and Killian\'s story is emotional, thrilling, sexy, filled with heartbreak, hope and promise. \n This book was perfect in every way. The boy and girl secretly in love with each other, the years spent apart, the incredible sexual chemistry between the hero and heroine, and the beautiful and strong families who support them both unconditionally. I adored how the author allowed Axelle to overcome her insecurities and become her own woman. I love everything JB Salsbury writes but FIGHTING FATE is one of her very best books!I didn\'t think it possible, but I have become an even bigger fan after reading FIGHTING FATE. The dual POV was perfection and I can\'t wait for more books from Ms. Salsbury. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(176, 24, 73, 4, 'Well that was very unexpected and different! I am a huge fan of L.H. Cosway and this is my first book by Penny Reid. This is part of the Rugby series but can absolutely be read as a standalone. This book is NOT your typical sports romance! It features a gorgeous ruby star who surprisingly, needs to learn some skills in the bedroom! This is a very funny and VERY sexy take on a familiar theme and I enjoyed every word of this story. \n Lucy is the sister of a star rugby player. She is quirky, different and has a very unusual way of dealing with anxiety - she has a compulsion to shoplift. Not so easy to hide when the media is lurking everywhere. At first she dislikes Sean, her brother\'s teammate, but beneath his bad-boy reputation is a kind, generous and loving soul. \n \"Beauty comes in many forms, and the strong, powerful kind is the most admirable. It\'s easy to be weak; you simply do nothing, but strength takes courage and effort.\" \n Sean has his own issues to deal with. He doesn\'t seem interested in proving his teammates wrong about his cocky reputation and his family is not exactly warm and fuzzy. Lucy is afraid of alienating her brother if he finds out that she and Sean are seeing each other, so they agree to keep their romance a secret at first. Lucy is going to teach Sean how to be a better lover - I LOVED how they did NOT start off with spectacular sex!! But Sean is so sweet and is a very, very good student. He begins to develop real feelings for Lucy and she begins to fall for Sean, too. \n \"I don\'t want to close my eyes when I could be looking at you\" \n The Player and the Pixie is a sweet, funny and totally fresh story. I absolutely adored Lucy and Sean and the very unique storyline. These two are very memorable characters and I highly recommend this book even if you are not usually a fan of sports romance! \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)');

(177, 24, 31, 5, '4.5 DIRTY STARS!! \n Refreshingly funny and SOOO sexy!! Kyle Scott is laugh-out-loud funny. \n DIRTY is a fantastic start to a new series from Kylie Scott. The book starts off with a bang and doesn\'t let up until the very end. Lydia has run away from her own wedding, climbing over a fence and right into an empty house. Except that the owner is there and is very surprised to find a runaway bride in his own bathroom, distraught and still in her wedding gown. \n \"Even with no clothing to take cues from, the dude was clearly the epitome of cool. He looked about my age, or maybe a little older. He had longish red-blond hair, dark blue eyes set in an angular face, a lean but muscular torso covered in tattoos, and a rather large cock. Not that I meant to check him out, it\'s just kind of hard to ignore a penis and scrotum when they\'re dangling right in front of your face. I tilted my head, trying to get some perspective. Every viewpoint, however, was equally shocking. There was dick as far as the eye could see. \n And I should stop ogling him. Right.\" \n This was supposed to be Lydia\'s wedding day and she is, to put it mildly, distraught. But she still maintains her sense of humor even in the face of a cheating ex-fiancee and his overbearing family. Vaughan is a nice guy and offers to let Lydia stay with him until she is able to get back on her feet. Even though he probably shouldn\'t trust a woman who has broken into his house, he likes her and her curves and her smart mouth. \n \"You touch any of my stuff?\" he asked. \"Take anything?\" \n \"Yes, your sofa is cunningly hidden down the front of my dress. You won\'t believe where I fit the TV.\" \n Again, his eyes narrowed dangerously. \"Between you and me, probably not the time to be funny, babe.\" \n Lydia finds herself working at the local Dive Bar with Vaughan and his family and friends. Lydia grows to love the Idaho town she has found herself in and can see herself making a life there and putting down roots. Vaughan, however, is a different story. He is chasing dreams of being a musician and isn\'t ready to give that up. He and Lydia really like each other but neither one is ready for anything serious, so, they agree to a friends-with-benefits arrangement. . . which, of course, means at least one of them is going to fall in love. Hey, this IS a romance, after all!! And who can resist Vaughan? \n \"Clearly, there were far more northern Idaho sex gods than I\'d given the region credit for. Further classifications were going to be required. If Vaughan topped the super-cool category, then maybe this new guy should win on the lumbersexual front. Given my abrupt return to singledom, I\'d have to give this important man-classification system more thought. \n Disclaimer: Objectifying people is wrong and stuff.\" \n DIRTY is a fun and funny, sexy, warm-hearted romance that hits all the right notes. There is no unnecessary drama and lots of fantastic, interesting supporting characters. I adored everything about this book. Ms. Scott is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I can\'t wait to read the next book in this series!! \n \"When his lips opened a little, just enough to softly kiss my bottom lip, I swear I swooned. Over and over he kissed my lips, first the top then the bottom, the sides and the corner from where my smile started. No part was left untouched. My smile grew wider, my nipples hard and my loins Vaughan-addled. That\'s a medical term.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

She barely escaped their break-up with her sanity intact and can\'t even begin to think about him being in her life again. Everything about Brigs is simply too painful for Natasha to deal with. \n \"Memories of love are a poison. My therapist told me that I have to embrace it.

What will he do now that she is in his life again? I was rooting for them from the beginning and read their story in one sitting.

This book was the perfect ending to the tale of Jackson and Jillian and all of the characters that I\'ve grown to love through the course of three books. \n Jillian Knight has become one of my favorite heroines ever. Damaged, feisty, strong-willed, smart and sarcastic, I was praying for her to have a happy ending!! And her unbreakable bond with her brother was absolutely brilliant. \n \"In so many ways the greatest love story of her life was not with Luke or AJ ... it was with Jackson. He was the constant in her life. His love defined unconditional. Someday she would tell him ... someday.\" \n These two characters managed to fight their way out of almost unimaginable circumstances and both fought to find normalcy and happiness and love. That sounds sappy but there is not one false moment in this book and the author\'s writing literally took my breath away!!

My heart is singing!I fell in love with Rose and Damon and all of the supporting characters in this book. SHOWMANCE is set in the world of musical theatre in London and centers around a production of Moulin Rouge. Rose is an assistant choreographer and lives and breathes dancing. But she is content to leave the spotlight to others, having suffered from stage fright most of her life. Enter Damon Atwood, a reclusive superstar who stepped away from the public spotlight at the height of his fame after years spent in a quiet fishing town. Damon will bring star power to the production and is paired with the gorgeous actress Alicia, who plays his co-star in the show. Rose instantly feels tremendous empathy for Damon, who is almost painfully shy in public but comes alive when singing and acting on the stage. \n \"You have no idea the kind of betrayal I\'ve suffered in my life... This friendship I have with you is a big deal. I haven\'t let someone into my life like I have you in years.\" \n SHOWMANCE is a very slow-burn romance, filled with stolen moments and tons of steamy, Alpha heat. Rose has sown off dating actors after being burned in past relationships. But Damon sees the beautiful soul that she is and can\'t help but fall in love with her. Although Damon is closed-off and shy in public, when he is alone with Rose, OMG!!! Their scenes together are absolutely unforgettable. \n In a heartbeat, every look we\'d shared flashed through my mind, from that initial fleeting glance across the dance studio the first time I\'d heard him sing, to this one. This one told me I owned his heart, his soul, his everything. \n This story has all the elements that I love: a smart and strong heroine, a damaged, sensitive hero and a creative, interesting plot. I loved the behind-the-scenes look into theatre production and the FANTASTIC cast of supporting characters, especially Rose\'s best friend Julian. I am THRILLED that Julian is getting his own book!!! I can\'t wait to see what the author does with this character. I could go on and on about this book, it is that perfect. L.H. Cosway is a brilliant writer and I devoured this book.

(183, 24, 62, 5, 'How I love Carnal!! \n Just when I thought another Kristen Ashley hero could not break my heart any more than her earlier heroes, along comes Deke Hightower. A loner, almost a recluse, a man of very few words (the original strong, silent type!), Deke has had a hard, tough life, never putting down roots anywhere and never, ever opening his heart to a woman. He is a simple man, a lover of his bike and the open road, which he makes VERY clear to everyone he meets. Deke and Justice have a history together (he just doesn\'t remember it!!) but when they meet again years later, they have a verrrry slow build-up, and the slow burn worked perfectly for these two. There are lots of misunderstandings, lots of miscommunications, but when these two get together....OMG!!!! Expect the usual HAWTNESS and over-the-top Alpha-male sexiness that is pure Kristen Ashley. \n One of the things I absolutely adored about this book was Deke. He is no kid (and neither is Justice), and Kristen Ashley describes him as all man and then some. \n \"...All of it covering exceptional pecs and the most amazing stomach I\'d ever seen. \n Not abs. \n A manly stomach. \n I had to admit, I was over the cut leanness that was all the rage. In the beginning, it was hot. But now it seemed daunting, men being so developed they didn\'t have an inch of extra flesh on them, not like they were human beings but like they were diagrams of a body\'s muscularity. \n Not Deke.\" \n *FAINTS* And Justice, I loved her! She is a gifted musician, with a renowned family but with lots and lots of heartache to go along with that. But this is Carnal and she is trying to hide out and get some peace. She hires Deke to renovate her new house and I think that Kristen Ashley must have a second secret career as a contractor. At first I thought there was too much detail about the house renovations but then I fell in love with the wonderful detail. Deke works with his hands, he takes pride in his work and the contrast between his blue-collar background and Justice\'s upbringing is both perfect and poignant at the same time. She has plenty of craziness to deal with, which Deke doesn\'t get at first. He really closes off his heart and Justice at first hides the fact that she remembers him from years before. He is almost sullen, but all of it comes from a place of heartbreak. \n \"My life, babe,\" he shook his head, \"until I was about twenty, it was not good.\" \"Okay,\" I prompted carefully, not liking that. \"And because a\' that, I got a way I gotta be and that\'s a way that\'s not gonna change.\" \n > \n All Justice wants is love and acceptance and some peace in her life. I loved that she was always herself around Deke, and eventually he warmed up to her cheerfulness, honesty and just plain goodness. It is difficult for a man like Deke to be with a brilliant and successful woman like Justice. But Deke, being Deke, accepts this in his own way. \n He squatted and reached into the bag. \n \"Open a beer for me, yeah?\" \n \"I live to serve.\" \n Deke wanted to test that but do it when they were both naked. \n Fuck him. \n Total dumbfuck. \n I must mention that FANTASTIC cast of secondary characters here. Each and every one felt fully developed and essential to the story. In my opinion, Kristen Ashley can pretty much write about anything and I will devour it. But when she writes about two people who have already lived a full life, who have their own demons and pasts, and who know what they want, well, to me that\'s a winner. Welcome back to Carnal, folks, it is a beautiful place. Enjoy the bounty. \n \"I was living it and all I had to do was take care of it, nurture it, make it stronger. \n Then it always would be mine. \n Everything I\'d ever wanted. \n My place in this universe. \n And it felt amazing.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

However, for someone like me who is obsessed with Joe Goldberg (and a little bit in love with him? Weird, I know), I was thrilled that there was more to this story. \n As funny as the author\'s commentary on NYC life was, she is even funnier and more on-point with her look at living in L.A. Don\'t fear, Joe is still as crazy as ever, but in an almost \"Being There\" fashion, everyone around him seems to mold him into what they believe him to be. \n And Joe is trying. He really is. But is still a complete and total sociopath. Despite that, I was really rooting for him to find true love in HIDDEN BODIES. But everyone is just so phony and materialistic and so Joe really believes he is justified in his actions.

I want to take ownership of all of her emotions and be the sole reason she trembles and cries.\" \n With those words, Pam Godwin has written on my favorite student-teacher dark romances. DARK NOTES is in the same category as UNTEACHABLE by Leah Raeder, with the rapid, short sentence style and the hopeless, yet hopeful, heroine. But Mr. Emeric Marceaux in in a class by himself (pun intended!) with his dark, dangerous and commanding nature. He knows what he wants and will do anything to make that happen. \n Ivory is a feisty, but dirt-poor music student who is out of her element at the expensive and elitist music school she attends. She is a senior and is trying desperately to make it to graduation so that she can secure a spot at a prestigious music academy. But she is the poorest student at the school, forced to do anything to survive. She barely has money for new shoes or the school uniform, let alone textbooks or the required tablet. \n Emeric is one commanding and bossy man. Whew. I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book but my God, this man is irresistible. He never, ever mistreats Ivory, unlike most of the other men in her life, and his heart literally aches for the proud student who refuses to take charity from anyone. \n \"All you need is a moment...This brutal man is my home. His hell is my heaven. I\'m his Ivory, and he\'s my darkest note.\" \n Emeric became obsessed with Ivory and although he knew he had to stay away, they were both immediately connected and believe me, this girl needed his protection in the worst way. I love Emeric and was completely invested in him and his need to protect Ivory. This is without a doubt one of the sexiest forbidden love stories I\'ve ever read. \n There is a fantastic, brutal, emotional and violent storyline that is pure Pam Godwin. The New Orleans setting is perfection, and having lived there for many years, I am always thrilled when an author gets the setting of the story just right. New Orleans is almost another character in this book, with its humidity, class system, funky neighborhoods and diverse music scene. \n Ivory is a feisty, strong heroine who will do whatever she needs to survive in her brutal world. She is no virginal, innocent heroine but she does have a refreshing honesty that I loved. Pam Godwin continues to be my go-to author for dark romance and DARK NOTES is just one more forbidden romance that hits all the right notes. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(187, 25, 86, 5, '4.5 - 5 SMOKING HOT STARS!! \n OMG I loved this book!!! Perfect mix of total hawtness and great writing. Funny, sexy, engaging. . . not what I expected AT ALL. Laurelin Paige and Sierra Simone are the complete package. I highly recommend this one!! \n Logan is a porn star but he really loves his job and makes no apologies for what he does. I loved the behind the scenes look into the porn industry and found it fascinating. Logan has had his heart broken by another adult film star but he has fantasized for years about Devi, who he met on set. Can two porn actors find true love together when their jobs involve having sex with other people? \n Believe it or not, this book is actually full of romance along with the amazingly hot sex scenes and dirty talk. Logan is actually very sweet and Devi is filled with dreams of going back to school and maybe, just maybe, having a \"real\" relationship with Logan. They make a reality-tv type of film together which follows them as they pretend \"date\" but they both begin to fall for each other. The lines between their series and reality quickly become blurred. This book is filled with surprises and even has some very funny moments. I love both of these authors and their first book together is hot, sweet and a total guilty pleasure. \n (ARC provided by the authors in return for an honest review.)'),
(188, 25, 88, 4, '4 SEXY, FUN STARS!! \n I will admit I did not think I would love this book as much as I did!! I am a HUGE fan of Alessandra Torre\'s writing, but I really thought this story might be a little too \"fluffy\" for me. I was completely wrong!! It is sexxxxxy, fun, sarcastic, witty and a love letter to New York City. The formatting of the book is gorgeous and very, very clever. \n Chloe lived a pampered life as part of New York City\'s wealthy elite. As an NYU student, she never had worry about such trivial things as money or tuition. All of that comes to a screeching halt when her parents lose everything after being assessed of insider trading. But Chloe is nothing if not resourceful and finds a job as a personal assistant to a spoiled, mean and self-centered socialite, who also thinks of herself as an actress. \n \"The wealth of the city lived in a different bubble than the rest of us. One where there were no worries of minor problems, the majority of which were easily solved by money. One comprised of beautiful women, powerful men, the drug of success heavy in the air, punctuated by diamond, caviar, and ego. For the first time, I was an outsider...\" \n Alessandra Torre writes some of my favorite books. She can be dark, twisty, and imaginative, and Love, Chloe shows what a versatile writer she is. This is a light, funny, romantic, fast-paced story, but with so many clever touches, that I enjoyed it immensely. Each chapter begins with an Instagram picture that were a perfect addition to the story. They set the tone for the next chapter and what was going on in Chloe\'s life. \n This is a standalone novel and it delves not only into the world of New York City socialites, but also into the making of a movie, A-List and B-List actors and trying to survive in the Big City. Chloe has had to grow up fast and complicating things is her old boyfriend who keeps making unwanted appearances in the new life she is trying to make for herself. \n Maybe the cultured, confident woman I was before was just a product of my parents\' money. Maybe now, with my new life a train wreck, I would discover the real Chloe Madison. \n And maybe, I wouldn\'t like her. \n Maybe it wasn\'t too late for me. \n Maybe all this was just my wakeup call. \n Chloe finally finds an apartment that she can afford on her own, now that she is gainfully employed, and wouldn\'t you know it, she has a HOT super who just turns out to be a NICE guy on top of all that hotness!! And of course you know that you will be treated to some SIZZLING sex scenes. Carter is a total doll and it is obvious he really likes Chloe. I loved that she was insecure, that she really ended up being a hard worker, that she did the \"right thing\" in the end (you\'ll see what I mean) and that Alessandra Torre gives her a happy ending that she deserves. Does she ALWAYS make the right choices? No. But Love, Chloe is a little \"slice-of-life\" very modern book that is immensely enjoyable. The author continues to surprise with her ability to write across different genres. If you are looking for a very fast-paced book with humor, heart and tons of steam, Love, Chloe is defintely for you! \n \"I love you, Chloe. Everything else fades away from that.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

(190, 25, 48, 4, '3.5 - 4 Stars!! \n There is so much to love about this book! The heroine is funny, feisty, different, and not afraid to be herself. The dialogue is sharp and Graham is devlishly sexy. The story begins with a creative premise: a lost cellphone on a train. Our heroine Soraya and Graham immediately clash when she goes to his offices to return his phone. He is a total asshole at work but he loves that she argues with him and isn\'t afraid of him at all. \n Soraya works for an advice columnist, doesn\'t love her job and has not had a successful sex life. She rides the train to and from work every day from her apartment in Brooklyn and that is how she first spots Graham. But these two could not more different! \n \"My life was far from Sex and the City. It was more like Sex and the Pity. Or Sex and the Shitty.\" \n There are lots of funny one-liners in this story and the plot is very fast-paced. Graham loves that Soraya is pierced and dyes the tips of her hair in wild colors. Different from the stuffy women he has been with in the past. I loved the major twist in the middle of this book: it injected lots of emotion and heart into this story. \n I loved the New York City setting but several unrealistic plot points interefered with my enjoyment of the story. These authors are wonderful at creating memorable characters and Stuck-Up Suit is no exception. The chemistry is explosive and the sexy times are very, very hot. \n \"It would be my pleasure to leave the gentleman at the door and fuck you four ways dirty.\" \n This book is perfect if you want a sexy, funny, fast-paced contemporary romance that offers an escape from reality for a few hours. And kudos to Ms. Ward and Ms. Keeland for creating a heroine who marches to the beat of her own drummer! \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)'),
(191, 25, 84, 4, '4 - 4.5 STARS! \n Sweetly smart romance with a magnificent hockey-playing hero! Who wouldn\'t fall in love with Tucker? \n This sexy NA/Sports Romance series was just what I needed to read right now: fast-paced, funny, light, with just the right touch of sweetness and steam. Tucker was a doll: a good boy who really loved Sabrina and wanted to stand by her no matter what when a surprise pregnancy interrupts their no-strings-attached relationship. Tucker was a fabulous hockey player with a bright future ahead of him but like Sabrina, he knows what he wants, too, and he goes after it. \n Sabrina has her goals set in stone: attend Harvard Law and then go on to work in a large, prestigious law firm. She works multiple jobs, studies hard and doesn\'t have much time for anything else. Her home life is the pits and she can\'t wait to get far away from her family. Tucker and Sabrina were perfect together! The steam factor is off the charts in this book!! \n \"Oh sweet baby Jesus. Sex with Tucker is dirtier and hotter than I thought it would be. He doesn\'t look like he\'d be this way, but isn\'t it always the quiet ones?\" \n Tucker was patient, yet a bit stalker-ish (thank God!) and overall, \'The Goal\' is another wonderfully-written story from Elle Kennedy. And the cover!! Hello, abs!! The secondary characters are strong and I loved seeing the characters from the earlier books here. With that said, you do not need to have read the earlier books in the series to love and enjoy \'The Goal\'. I loved the message here and the Epilogue was soooo sweet! Thanks, Elle, for another sexy couple in the Off-Camput Series! \n \"My goal, once upon a time, was to succeed. I didn\'t realize that success wasn\'t grades or scholarships or achievements, but the people I was lucky enough to have in my life.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

I just wanted to stay right here - literally pressed between a rock and a hard place. Forever.\" \n WELL HELLO, GRUMPY BEARDED FARMER!! Sarina Bowen NEEDS to write more adult contemporary romance! OMG Griffin is one of THE sweetest and sexiest heroes EVER. Adored the story. Sexy, funny and smart. Fabulous beginning to what I\'m sure will be a fantastic series!! \n I absolutely loved this story about Griff, a super-hot and always-grumpy farmer who lives and works with his large family on their farm in Vermont. I loved the wonderful details about apple farming, organic farming and the agricultural business!! This eye for detail just shows what an incredibly talented writer Sarina Bowen is. \n Audrey is struggling to make her mark in the Boston restaurant world and is called upon to visit several farms in Vermont as part of her job. She runs into Griif, with whom she had a few hot hook-ups in college. Back then he was a superstar football player, but he thought she was a sorority party girl and she thought he would never be interested in someone like her. \n Flash forward to the present, Audrey is trying to make it on her own without the help of her wealthy mother. Her bosses aren\'t exactly ethical in their business dealings, which Griff makes quite clear to her. BUT these two have some AMAZINGLY hot chemistry and can\'t seem to stay away from each other. I must say that Sarina Bowen surprised me with the heat level in BITTERSWEET!!! Griff is hot, sweet, huge and BEARDED. Audrey is hooked! But these two could not be more different: Griff is serious, usually grumpy and completely immersed in running his farm and the business side of farming, while Audrey, who is smart and driven, is funny, outgoing and much more of a people person. \n \"You\'re the sweet that balances out my natural tannins.\" \n Griff is my kind of hero. Hardworking, sexy, sweet, devoted to his family...and when he opens up to Audrey and shows his true feelings, OMG!!! Perfection. \n \"There was nothing I wouldn\'t have given her at that moment. Skin to skin with her was the only place I wanted to be.\" \n There is an incredible cast of supporting characters, I would love to read a story about each and every one. BITTERSWEET has humor, heat, wonderful writing and and a fast paced story. And plenty of sexy times to satisfy even the most jaded of contemporary romance readers (like me!) The only thing that kept this book from being a 5 star read for me was a scene early on that I felt was out of place in a sexy contemporary romance story. Other than that, I highly recommend this sweet, sexy and funny story!! Can\'t wait to read the next book in this series!! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(193, 25, 33, 5, '\"For good or bad, all roads led back to him. Perhaps that\'s what it meant to really be his.\" \n I could not. Put. This. Book. Down. Simply out, this book grabbed me from the beginning and I haven\'t been able to stop thinking about Emily and Reeve since I finished. FIRST TOUCH is without a doubt one of my favorite books of the year. It is stunning and a true page-turner! \n The plot, the pacing, the hotter-than-hot sex scenes, the emotion, the characters...all pure perfection. I love Laurelin Paige\'s writing but with FIRST TOUCH, she has written the best book of her career. Run, don\'t walk, to buy this book! \n I absolutely love a damaged heroine when written well. Emily is an incredibly real, thoughtful, smart and beautiful woman, who lived a very fast and dangerous lifestyle when she was young. Her \"partner in crime\" was her best friend Amber, with whom she lost touch but who has now reached out to Emily. Amber represents a part of Emily\'s past that she\'d like to put behind her, but Emily is forced into using her beauty and charm once again in order to seduce the man she believes might hold the clues to Amber\'s whereabouts. \n \"Men were my drug. Staying away from them had been the only way I knew to stay clean. The only way to reinvent myself.\" \n Amber has disappeared, is somehow in danger and Emily feels she owes it to Amber to help her. Amber did the same for Emily many times when they were younger, and Emily senses that Amber needs her now. To that end, Emily sets her sights on wealthy hotelier Reeve, who might be the only link she has to Amber. Reeve, it seems, is only interested in a purely sexual arrangement with the alluring Emily. But Emily can\'t help but fall for the hot, yet emotionally reserved playboy. \n \"His grip was strong and sure and aggressive. Almost too tight, but just barely not. He held it without saying anything for several seconds, and, I don\'t know how-- somehow, though-- I knew he was making his own allusion. His own promise. He wanted me to know what he\'d be like. In bed. With me. He\'d be powerful and controlling and forceful, even. Almost too forceful, but just barely not. Was that how he\'d been with her? Did almost become too much?\" \n This book is part erotic romance, part thriller, part romantic suspense...FIRST TOUCH has it all. There are some VERY graphic sex scenes in this book and the steam factor is off the charts!! But there is much more to this story than just the erotic elements. My heart absolutely ached for the suffering Emily had endured; and I was literally holding my breath in anticipation throughout the story, hoping against hope that she and Reeve would develop real feelings for each other, beyond their agreed-upon sexual arrangement. Emily\'s pretend seduction of Reeve quickly turns into something more and she knows that Reeve represents the possibility of a real connection, real feelings, but he is hiding many secrets of his own. \n \"Because the only thing worse than falling under Reeve\'s spell would be me believing that he\'d fallen under mine as well.\" \n There is a large cast of characters in FIRST TOUCH - some might be dangerous, some might not be, and some might know what happened to Amber. One thing is for sure, nothing is as it seems in FIRST TOUCH. And that is what makes this such an outstanding story. \n Favorite quote: \n \"This is only today. Tomorrow\'s going to be something else entirely.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(194, 25, 43, 4, '3.5 - 4 Stars \n This is the very sexy and very sweet sequel to the short story, Hearts in Darkness. This book picks up shortly after Caden and Makenna first met in the darkened elevator. They have developed an almost-perfect relationship - and this book is verra verra steamy - but Caden has severe PTSD due to a very shocking incident in his past that has completely traumatized him. \n This is one of those stories where the hero doesn\'t think he is good enough for the heroine - she is smart, kind, beautiful, has a wonderful family, etc. - so the hero must distance himself from her \"for her own good.\" Makenna loves Caden but realizes that he is gun-shy and she is scared to make her true feelings known. When she does, all hell breaks loose. \n This is a lovely, steamy story with lots of angst and a beautiful HEA.

(195, 25, 36, 5, 'Slip of the Tongue is absolutely enthralling. Jessica Hawkins continues to be one of the most underrated contemporary romance authors today. I ADORED this book!!! \n I am personally a fan of love triangles in books - I know, a little strange, but I love the emotion, the forbidden-love aspect and and the thrill of it all. So if you are not a fan, then this book is probably not for you. Sadie has been married to an amazing man who has suddenly and inexplicably shut down. Nathan has stopped communicating with Sadie, seems to not want her anymore, and pretty much just shuts her out. She tries to get through to him, to no avail. Enter sexy neighbor Finn, who is smart, sweet, and makes his intentions very clear from the start. \n I have LOVED this author\'s writing ever since I read her Cityscape series (which I highly recommend.) Ms. Hawkins made me FEEL Sadie\'s insecurities, her inner battles and her fear of losing her husband and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster from the first page of this book. This is a very adult and very passionate book where not all is black-and-white. Yes, Nathan seems perfect and yes, Sadie makes some mistakes, but she is human and I found the story to be very believable. I loved Finn and could see why Sadie was so conflicted. She love her husband but feels like her marriage is over. All of the characters in this book are incredibly well written and I connected with them from the start. \n Finn and Sadie have explosive chemistry AND so do Sadie and Nathan! The sex scenes are absolutely incredible. I loved everything about this book and loved the conclusion. Kudos to Jessica Hawkins for another incredibly sexy and addictive story. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Jen Frederick has a gift for sparkling dialogue and nuanced characters that elevate her books to the top of the sports-romance genre. This story is funny, fast-paced and shows off the author\'s deep love and knowledge of the sport of football. Lucy and Matty are adorable and the sex scenes were waaaaay steamier than I expected. And the banter between these two is priceless! \n \"I know how to cook, and have, at some points in my life, operated an iron.\" He ticks off each skill on a finger. \"I always bring the good booze when I\'m invited to a party, and I make my bed in the morning.\" \n \"You had me at know how to cook.\" \n Who doesn\'t love a gorgeous, smart athlete who\'s also senstive, depsite his party-boy reputation? Matty is one of the author\'s most endearing characters. Lucy is hilarious, and her inner dialogue is pure gold. \n The girls must have spotted Matt because they bypass three open tables to walk by ours. As they pass, there\'s a contest of who can flip her hair over her shoulder the hardest. I swear the last two eye fuck him so hard, it\'s a wonder they make it to their own table upright. \n There\'s a very sweet twist to this story, and I found the peek into the inner workings of a college football team fascinating. If you want a well-written, fresh college romance, without unrealistic and unecessary drama, pick up JOCKBLOCKED. It is part of an internconnected series but can defintely be read as a standalone. And be prepared for Matty to steal your heart!! \n He watches me while I pull on my coat. \"You\'re right that there\'s nothing wrong with how you\'re living. I\'m not judging that. I\'m just saying maybe your life could be happier.

Regan and Silas burn up the pages in THREE DIRTY SECRETS!!!! Silas is just, well, irresistible. A hunky, smart, artistic, and Alpha tattoo artist?? Sign me up. \n This isn\'t the tired old girl-meets-guy, girl-loses-guy, girl-gets-guy back story. Regan is working as an undercover FBI agent in the Blindfold Club, which is really a side story to the main event of her sizzling romance with Silas Getty. She is an aggressive cop and Silas is aggressive, too, so what to do with that?! Nikki Sloane wraps it all up pretty nicely in this steamy, sexy story. \n \"We had heat by the truckload, but this was something else. Passion. So different, and so much better.\" \n Regan is still reeling from a prior undercover operation gone wrong so she is distant with Silas, reserved in her emotions but he is passionate and loves that Regan is a tough-talking, no-nonsense woman. She is afraid of falling for him but quickly that he might just be THE perfect man for her. \n \"I\'d failed all of my objectives when it came to Silas.. . and I hadn\'t outlined any ground rules about keeping things between us casual. Last Sunday had been anything but casual.\" \n THREE DIRTY SECRETS is as much of a romantic suspense as it is a BDSM-themed book, the action is fast-paced and the sex scenes are absolutely incendiary. This book is for mature readers only!! There are threesomes that are scorching hot and main characters who are passionate, driven and not afraid to take what they want. I highly recommend this story, it is another winner in the Blindfold Club Series!! \n FAVORITE QUOTE: \n My mouth opened, but his hand slapped over it, silencing me. His expression was wild, like a man pushed to the brink. He looked dangerous, and fucking gorgeous. \"I couldn\'t wait any longer,\" he muttered. \"Deal with it.\" Beneath his palm, I smiled.

(198, 25, 90, 4, '>4.5 Sweet & Steamy Stars!! \n Cardeno C. is one of my favorite authors. Her books always contain a perfect mix of spicy and sweet, and the heat level is always just perfect for me. Her stories are always interesting, sometimes poignant, but never fail to contain a ton of heart so I absolutely love reading them. This book is the first in a series but can be read as a standalone. Asher is a dominant cop but this story just touches on BDSM themes, nothing too heavy here. Asher meets a younger man while in Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Daniel is the COMPLETE opposite of Asher! He\'s a free spirit, but he too is very attracted to Asher. \n Asher\'s protective tendencies come to the forefront with Daniel but the problem is Daniel is looking for a relationship, and Asher, not so much. I loved seeing how the relationship between these two changed and grew. AS with all Cardeno C. books, the characters are EVERYTHING and Daniel and Asher do not disappoint. Just look at this gorgeous cover for a hint of the steam level of this story, it is a perfect mix of total hotness and sentimental sweetness. Some readers complained about the stalker-ish tendencies of Asher but I didn\'t get that at all. He is just a big bear of a man trying to find his way to true love (awwwwww!!). \n Something in the Way He Needs is another perfectly sexy romance from Cardeno C. with just the right touch of emotion and steam!

CRAZY GOOD was a sexy, refreshing, very readable story with an unforgettable Alpha and it was exciting to read a new author. Unfortunately, TIME AND SPACE did not work for me at all. There is a dramatic, totally unbelievable plot twist literally dropped into the story with zero explanation or set-up. Added to the large number of editing and grammar issues, I\'m afraid this just wasn\'t for me. Perhaps some editing next time around will help. I will definitely give this author a try again but this whole book was just a giant puzzle to me.'),
(200, 26, 16, 5, 'My first thoughts upon completing this book, \"MY HEART. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS SERIES IS OVER!! Another perfect heart-stopping story from Kristen Ashley.\" \n This series holds a very special place in my heart because KNIGHT was my very first Kristen Ashley book ever. I didn\'t quite fully understand the warning that came along with that book, because to me, KNIGHT was absolute perfection. After I then read almost every single book Ms. Ashley wrote, I realized that the Unfinished Heroes Series was a bit different from her other, mostly-nice, all swoony Alpha heroes. And I adore every single one of her \"unfinished\" heroes. \n SEBRING was like unwrapping a special gift. Olivia was a complex heroine, damaged and scarred both indies and out, having grown up into a crime family. She trusts no one, and for good reason. Her own family is treacherous, immoral and very dangerous. But yet she cannot escape the life that has been mapped out for her. She is an obedient daughter, following the rules until the night she meets Nick Sebring. Olivia is closed off to the world and has given up all hopes for a normal life. \n \"I\'d learned that I didn\'t allow myself to show emotion. \n Ever\" \n I was always fascinated by Nick since he first appeared in KNIGHT. He has a fascinating back story here, investigating Olivia\'s family and targeting her in an effort to infiltrate the Shade family to take down her father. Nick\'s first love was caught up in their violent world and became victim of the Shade family\'s notorious brand of violence. \n SEBRING is not a pretty, hearts and flowers, sweet love story. Its is gritty, raw, violent, yet amongst all of that, Kristen Ashley\'s trademark goodness and beauty and love shines through. Nick Sebring himself does not think he can be redeemed but something about Olivia sings to him. They make the perfect couple, really. They both love a certain brand of kink and tom me, are PERFECTLY matched. \n There is plenty of heartbreak in this book. Olivia carries around secrets in her heart that would absolutely break another person. So it makes her coming together with Nick Sebring even more bittersweet and gorgeous. And Nick...well, I fell in love with him. Yes, the very same Nick Sebring from KNIGHT who caused so much trouble! SEBRING is everything I love about a Kristen Ashley book: family, incredibly hot sex scenes, fast-paced action, forgiveness and yes, love. I can\'t recommend this book highly enough. Happy reading! \n Favorite quote: \n \"I\'m not bawling.\" \n \"You were close.\" \n \"You were being sweet.\" \n \"Like I said, get used to that.\" \n \"Then you were an ass.\" \n \"You should probably get used to that too.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

That is what happened with THE BALLER. What I though would be a standard, predictable sports romance turned into a page-turner for me, with a sudden and very unexpected twist in the middle of the story! \n Delilah is a successful sports journalist (another I love about Vi Keeeland\'s books - her heroines are all smart, feisty women) who is assigned to interview superstar football player Brody Easton. She has had a bit of a dry spell lately which might just be coming to an end with the entry of Brody into her life. \n \"That man isn\'t into me. He wants in to me.\" \n \"Same thing.\" \n \"No. There\'s a major difference.\" \n Brody lays his cards out on the table pretty much from the beginning. From playing a locker room prank on Delilah, to pursuing her relentlessly, I absolutely loved watching their relationship develop. \n But Brody has a major secret he is hiding. Will it destroy Delilah\'s trust, once she finally lets herself open up to Brody? \n I read this book in almost one sitting, it was that enjoyable. I adore Brody, he is cocky yet funny, sexy yet very, very smart and intuitive and very much in tune with what women want. The story takes a surprising turn which I did NOT see coming and I literally could not tell where the author was going to take this story. The ending was very satisfying and I highly recommend THE BALLER!! You will love it. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy write some of the best new adult romance today and they hit it out of park again (or made a goal??) with US. I fell in love all over again with Jamie Canning and Ryan Wesley. If you are looking to try a MM story, I highly recommend this series. It is pure romance! \n Wes and Jamie are faced with the real-life pressures of a modern couple when Wes travels with his pro team and Jamie begins a job coaching. Added to the stress of their relationship is that fact that Wes is still hiding his relationship with Jamie. It pained me to suffer alongside both Wes and Jamie when they could not go public with their relationship. A sudden, devastating illness makes everything very clear to Wes and finally gives these two some of the normalcy that other couples enjoy. Leave it to these two authors to write an engaging, hot, funny and very sentimental story that shows the reader that love is for everyone. \n I also adored Blake, who was funny and a true friend. Hello, he deserves his own book!! US is a wonderfully romantic and incredibly sexy story about two people in love.

(206, 26, 90, 5, 'The Shadow is a lush, passionate and complex story, filled with romance, art, history and suspense. I am not a huge fan of paranormal stories but I make an exception for Sylvain Reynard\'s books. I LOVE the Gabriel\'s Redemption series and Professor Gabriel Emerson makes an appearance here. What more could you ask for? \n William and Raven are reunited in this story but William is battling forces who are trying to sabotage him. He has finally found the love of his life and he wants nothing more than to worship Raven forever. \n \"I will never have your nobility of spirit, or your protective nature, but as long as I have your love, I can be content.\" \n William will stop at nothing to protect Raven from both other vampires and from those who scheme to drive them apart. There is lots of action and mystery, written in the style that is completely unique to Sylvain Reynard. This is a very sensual and passionate book, and even if you do not usually read paranormal romance, you will love this story. The streets of Florence seem to come alive! \n We also learn about William\'s early life and the tragic story of how he lost his first love. Raven is completely trusting of him and along with the intrigue, there is also a little humor here, too. \n \"You\'re giving me a toothache.\" \n He pulled back. \"How is that possible?\" \n She laughed. \"It\'s a figure of speech. It means you\'re being too sweet. Say something awful.\" \n William\'s expression changed and he brought his lips to her ear. \"I want to take you back to the house, so I can spread you on my bed and do all kinds of wicked things to you.\" \n I can\'t wait to see what happens next! The Shadow is a beautifully written book and my favorite in the Florentine Series so far. Lush, lyrical, passionate and very intense. The outtakes are absolutely fantastic. Don\'t miss it!! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(207, 26, 95, 4, '3.5 Stars!! \n Swoony, sweetly romantic, SEXY and very, very readable standalone in the Manwhore series! LOVED Tahoe Roth. He\'s not such a bad boy, after all! Gina is a relatable, very real heroine. \n Add in an irresistible hero and perfectly romantic story, and this is a real-life fairytale come true. \n (Copy provided by the publisher for an honest review.)'),
(208, 26, 65, 4, '\"Charli Moore I like you.I have since the first time I saw you.\" \n I am a hug fan of Aleatha Romig. Her Consequences series is an absolute favorite of mine and is one of those series that you can\'t stop talking about non-stop with anyone who\'ll listen to your ranting and raving about Tony Rawlings. \n I couldn\'t wait to read BETRAYAL, the first in a series of 5 full-length novels in the Infidelity series. Now, while cheating does not bother me in the least, for those of you who might shy away from such books, rest assured that\'s NOT what this book is about. At all. Alexandria has grown up very wealthy, and has tried to break free from her extremely dysfunctional family by attending college as far away as possible from her controlling family and wicked stepfather. \n After gradating from college, she yearns to \"cut loose\" and does just that during one week at a resort with her best friend. She meets a mysterious, sexy, uber-Alpha named Nox and they embark on a passionate and intense, no-strings-attached week. She uses the name Charli so that she can remain completely anonymous. But they will have just one week together, even though she clearly develops intense feelings for the stunning Nox. \n \"Our first time will be what you want, what you fantasize about. I\'m going to take you, right here, right now.\" \n WOW!! Their scenes together are richly written and breathtaking and they have tons of chemistry. I absolutely loved the alternating timeframes which added to overall feeling of tension and foreboding. There is a completely surprising twist at the end, and if you have a few hours, then prepare to become completely captivated by the sexy Nox and smart, beautiful Alex. Her family drama back home in Savannah, Georgia was a little over-the-top for me but does serve to show how far she has come to break away from her controlling family. \n This book really brings the story together at the end and it definitely ends on a cliffhanger! I can\'t wait to see what happens next for Alex and Nox!!'),
(209, 26, 12, 4, '4.5 STARS \n Crashed Out is exactly why I LOVE Tessa Bailey\'s books! It\'s lusty, funny and filled with lots of real emotion and heart. And an older woman/younger man theme? YES, PLEASE!! \n I SWOONED over Sarge. He left town years before as a shy, introverted teenager and has now returned to town a rock star. He has come back to visit his sister and her child and take a break from the pressures of band life. But even though he is now famous, he has never forgotten his older sister\'s best friend, Jasmine. He has been in love with her since he was young, but she never paid much attention to him. But now...well, let\'s just say things have changed a LOT since Jasmine last laid eyes on Sarge!! \n \"But television-size and life-size were two very different things, apparently, because Sarge had been remodeled from a one-story colonial into a big brick mansion.\" \n Jasmine resists Sarge\'s attention but he pursues her relentlessly (thank God). He is sexy...intense...sensitive...just totally irresistible. Much of the fun of reading a Tessa Bailey book is the trademark dirty talk and boy, does she deliver here. My word. Sarge is EVERYTHING!! And he writes music!! As for Jasmine, I absolutely adored the fact that she was quite a few years older than Sarge and was filled with insecurities. Why would Sarge be interested in her? After all, he could have anyone he wanted. But he has never forgotten the girl he left behind, and he is bound and determined to make her forget their age difference: \n \"No more fixing me sandwiches. No more ruffling my goddamn hair.\" He reached down and grasped her hand, bringing it to the back of his head, moving it in a messy circle. \"If I ever feel your fingers in my hair again, they\'d better be pulling my face closer to whatever I\'m licking.\" \n I also loved how Sarge encouraged Jasmine to pursue her dreams, and as with all of Ms. Bailey\'s stories, family plays an important role here. Crashed Out has turned out to be one of my favorite books by Tessa Bailey. I cannot wait for more stories in this series. I highly recommend Crashed Out if you love an uber-sexy, steamy story with plenty of heart!! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(210, 26, 44, 4, '4 - 4.5 Stars \n I loved this book!! I am obsessed with Zaal Kostava. This is a really dark but VERY sexy and enjoyable story. Reap is filled with passion, emotion and heat. It is most definitely my favorite Tillie Cole book. The horribly scarred and damaged Zaal absolutely broke my heart. But his beauty and soul shine through when he finds kindness and yes, even love, after many tortuous twists and turns. Although this should read after Raze, it is a stunning story and I highly recommend both books. Talia is a fantastic heroine, strong, beautiful and compassionate. Loving Zaal might come with dire consequences, but she cannot be without him. \n \"You are my Zaal, the man whose soul has stolen mine.\" \n There are terribly violent and dark themes in this book but I loved it and could not put it down! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(211, 26, 4, 5, '4.5 Thrilling Stars!! \n WOW!! Spellbinding, engrossing and sensual, Madame X is a richly detailed story that is filled with mystery and suspense. Very adult and incredibly sexy, this story completely took me by surprise and I can\'t recommend it highly enough! \n The blurb to this book is really just a small part of this story, and it is interesting that none of the main characters are mentioned by name in the synopsis. I had not read any reviews on this one going in so I am going to keep this short. If you are looking for a very adult, very sensual read, then Madame X is for you. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book and I absolutely fell in love with the male protagonists (yes, plural) and cannot WAIT for the next book! \n \"Your sexuality belongs to me, X. No one else may even so much as fucking smell you, do you understand me? You. Are. Mine.\" \n There is a touch of BDSM in this book but I believe that more will be revealed on that front in the next story. There are themes of dominance and control here but I was thrown off guard several times by the direction that this story took. \n We are introduced to both Caleb and Logan in this story and while one might seem cruel, controlling and calculating, I do not believe that all is at seems and that Logan, who we meet later in the story, will also have many, many layers to him. I don\'t think there are any real villains or heroes in this book (I think?! I could be very wrong!) and that is the genius of this story. \n Sexy, explicit, fast-paced and very, very creative, Madame X thrilled me on many levels. I couldn\'t put it down! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(212, 26, 100, 4, '4 - 4.5 Stars!! \n WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! \n This book picks up from the end of Book 1, and explores Weston pursuing Mirella. Please note that this is the second book in a trilogy and most definitely ends with an incredible cliffhanger! I found this book to be incredibly gripping, dealing with a taboo subject in an erotic, almost romantic way. \n Ms. Roya\'s writing is charming and playful at times and almost addictive. I was absolutely fascinated by Weston and Gabe and was kept on the edge of my seat waiting for their marriages and their relationships to crash and burn. \n \"We didn\'t learn from our mistakes. We just made them all over again.\" \n I found myself thinking about these characters even when I wasn\'t reading, which to me, is the sign of a good book. Mirella and Weston go back to their arrangement but Mirella lays down the new rule: their relationship is to be only physical, with no emotional attachment. Weston falling in love with her is what got them into trouble the first time around. \n \"I shouldn\'t have let this all this get so out of control.\" \n This book is still told only from Mirella\'s POV but it delves more into describing Gabe and Weston\'s feelings. Bridget, however, is still very much a mystery. I would love to know more about her. In Book 2, the two couples try to have a \"normal\" relationship, which does require a suspended sense of reality, but I loved the way Ms. Roya explored the boundaries of their relationships. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop here, either by Gabe ending the open marriage arrangement or by Weston falling in love with Mirella all over again. I was not disappointed! This is an incredibly addictive story, and I can\'t wait for the next book in this trilogy. I am dying to read more about Gabe and Weston, two very passionate, sexy characters who each deserve their own book! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

(214, 26, 91, 5, '4.5 Passionate Stars!! \n MAJOR heartache. MAJOR passion. And a strong heroine with a painful past! I\'m obsessed with Scarlett and Dante!! \n \"Love is War\" is a great description of this second chance, lovers-to-enemies story. BREAKING HIM was nothing that I expected. I need the second book yesterday! I must know more about Scarlett and Dante!! \n This story has very much of a Tristan-and-Danika feel to it. The chemistry between Scarlett and Dante is almost so real, you can feel it leap off the pages. Why is Scarlett so ANGRY about everything? At first, her prickly attitude kept me at a distance, but once I learned more about her character and her background, I absolutely fell in love with her and was rooting for her. And Dante, well he seems like the perfect guy at first and I just know that he will end up doing the right thing. He and Scarlett MUST be together! They are meant for each other!! Do you hear me, Author Lady?! \n The secondary characters are all fantastic, and are an integral part of the story. Ms. Lilley does a great job of describing the social hierarchy of small town life and how stifling it can be for those who do not \"fit in\". I literally read this book in one sitting and cannot wait for the continuation of Scarlett and Dante\'s story. Ms. Lilley has once again created an absolutely unforgettable couple whose passion and chemistry burned through every page. \n Favorite quote: \n \"I have tormented some sweet men. Broken hearts and shattered dreams. \n Men are punching bags, and I have a hell of a right hook.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(215, 26, 76, 4, '4.5 Sexy, Gritty Stars!! \n Karina Halle never ceases to amaze with her writing! She can take a reader from swoony, sexy contemporary romance, to stories like Dirty Promises, a brutal, rough, gritty and violent story that is incredibly gripping, sexy and readable. \n Javier Bernal is a cruel man. Yet I still felt sympathy for him (it\'s true!) because if you have taken the journey with this character, you will know he is the product of his history and background. But make no mistake, this book is violent and is set in the world of drug cartels. If you are looking for a different read, with fantastic writing, then I highly recommend this series. \n Javier and Luisa have a marriage that is on the brink of falling apart. Their story here is an incredibly wild ride and is most definitely NOT for the faint of heart. But if you are willing to take a risk with your reading, then you will be immensely rewarded. I did not know what to expect with DIRTY PROMISES because I knew this would be a gritty story, maybe even more so than the other books in this series. Karina Halle really delivers the goods with this book and if you are a fan of dark, action-packed stories with a very damaged \"hero\", then please read this series. The books and the characters are unforgettable!! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Be warned that this story involves an innocently sexy 18 year old and her father\'s virile best friend, who also happens to be the football coach at her school - sounds really taboo but it all seems to work! You can literally read this book in about 2 hours. Jump on board the breeding train with Alexa Riley\'s COACH! You\'ll be glad you did!'),
(217, 26, 49, 5, '4.5 - 5 Heart-Stopping Stars \n This book is why I read contemporary romance. The swoony hero, the beautiful, sweet heroine who is hiding a tragic secret, the explosive passion, but most of all, the deep and emotional connection I felt for Adam and Evie all added up to a perfect page-turner that kept me up all night. \n Adam!! My heart broke for him and for the love he lost with Evie. Adam and Evie (LOVE the names!) fell in love when they were just teenagers. Adam did not trust many people so when Evie suddenly disappeared, he became even more bitter than he was before. He spends years searching for her and when he finally finds her, his feelings are a mix of rage and heartbreak over their lost years. Evie refuses to tell him why she disappeared suddenly all those years before, so their reunion is bittersweet, filled with longing and regret, but also undeniable and explosive passion. \n WHEN I WAS YOURS is told through a series of flashbacks which put me through every single emotion possible. The story, set against the backdrop off Hollywood and the mega-rich, is more than just a classic rich boy meets poor girl love story. It\'s sexy, heartfelt, and heartbreaking all at once. The unexpected twist had my heart in my throat and had me silently cheering for our MC\'s to get their happily ever after. \n \"You cut your hair.\" \n \"It has been ten years.\" \n \"I know. I just...I remember a time when you said you\'d never cut your hair.\" A small smile touches my lips at the memory. \n \"Yeah, and I remember when you promised to love me till death do us part. Shit changes.\" \n My smile drops from my face. My cheeks sting like he\'s just slapped me. \n I deserved that. Doesn\'t stop it from hurting like a bitch though. \n Samantha Towle is one of my favorite writers and she absolutely delivered the goods with this story. The characters and their sweet, sexy and passionate love story won\'t soon be forgotten. Ever since I saw this stunning cover, I knew I just had to read this book! I absolutely adored Adam and Evie\'s story! Don\'t miss it. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

(219, 27, 39, 5, 'How do you describe the feeling that you get when you read a Kristen Ashley book? It is very hard to describe the emotions in simple words. Gut-wrenching? Heart-pounding? All of those happen to me and when a book is the end of a beloved series, well, let\'s just say that I was a sobbing mess while reading this Epilogue. \n I binge read The \'Burg Series several years ago while on a long vacation that involved a lot of driving. Needless to say, I volunteered to sit in the back seat while on most of this vacation so I could read this fantastic series! As with all of her books, each of Ms. Ashley\'s series are slightly different; in the \'Burg, the characters are all a little older, a lot jaded, fiercely protective, and above all, unforgettable. \n HOLD ON is a spectacular end to the series. Cher appeared earlier in the series, a hard-luck woman who struggles to keep her head above water and lives paycheck-to-paycheck to support herself and her beloved son. She never, ever believes that love will happen for her, and never, ever believes that she will find happiness with a man who will love and cherish her and her son. Cher broke my heart over and over, and I cried many times throughout this book at her sadness and despair. \n \"But he\'d never give me what I wanted. \n I forgot. \n I forgot that I wasn\'t the kind of girl who got what she wanted. \n Not once. \n Not in my whole f*g life. \n Yeah, I\'d forgotten that.\" \n Cher has a major case of unrequited love for Garrett (Merry), who in turn cannot forget the ex-wife who broke his heart. Sounds like a real downer of a book, right? But no! HOLD ON is a tale of mended hearts, beautiful possibilities and bright futures that everyone dreams about in their heart of hearts. There is no one who can infuse a story with magnificence and hope like Ms. Ashley. And HOLD ON is the perfect story of love and redemption, of fighting for what you want, and for holding on when you know you have goodness within your grasp. \n The ending of this book very much reminded me of the series finale of one of my favorite TV shows, Six Feet Under. Kristen Ashley is the Queen of epilogues and I will never, ever forget this one. I am so sad to say goodbye to the families of the \'Burg but I know that Ms. Ashley has even more goodness in store for her readers. I can\'t wait to see what she comes up with next. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(220, 27, 65, 4, 'Adorably sexy and very funny! This book is another fresh, modern, sexy and hilarious story from R.S. Grey. \n The Allure of Dean Harper follows the story of Dean and Lily, the best friends of Julian and Jo from The Allure of Julian Lefray. Lily has just arrived in New York City and is opinionated, talented and very, very funny. She and Dean do not meet under the best of circumstances. Dean, a control freak and workaholic, arrives back from a business trip and his first meeting with his new bartender does not go well. The extremely talented Lily has been hired as a temporary bartender, and although she is incredible at her job, she immediately clashes with Dean and is actually fired right then and there. \n From there, this funny enemies-to-lovers takes off into a fast-paced, behind-the-scenes peek into the competitive world of the restaurant business. Lily and Dean clearly are attracted to each other but they both bring out the worst in each other. Lily is outspoken and knowledgeable and I loved that she wouldn\'t back down from her opinions. Dean is driven, stubborn and very difficult. Their banter is witty and this story is the kind of book that R.S. Grey writes best. The scenes where Lily tries to adapt to life in the city are priceless. \n This is a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud, classic enemies-to-lovers story. If you are looking for a modern, funny and light read, with a HEA, then you will love The Allure of Dean Harper! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

I literally felt dropped right into the middle of a story that had already begun, which was very disorienting. While many readers are raving about this book, for me there was no connection between the main characters and many of their actions felt mechanical, and the story, formulaic.

Have a cold shower ready, ladies, you will need one after reading this one. \n Although this is the third book in a series, it is a complete standalone. The author does an amazing job of giving just the right amount of background on the Blindfold Club and on the characters in this book. The story is fantastic and the sex scenes...well, they are absolutely scorching. There is a threesome (almost a foursome, kind of a two + two-some) that rivals anything I\'ve ever read. And I do love a good menage scene or three! \n Em is the classic \"good girl\": she\'s smart, follows the rules but is wealthy in her own right. Joseph is the owner of the \"Blindfold Club\", an elite place where the woman have sex with their clients while blindfolded. High-end prostitutes but Em doesn\'t know this side of Joseph\'s business. She just thinks he is a wealthy club owner who has a very, very kinky side, and she wants to be very, very bad. \n \"Being wrong and bad was just as I\'d hoped it would be. It was so, so good.\" \n Joseph is a Dom and is several years older than Em. He is insanely attracted to her innocence and youth and they begin an affair where he will teach her how to be a submissive. Em is completely different from the other women Joseph has been with and he quickly becomes addicted to her, despite there being a million reasons why they shouldn\'t be together. \n Now this might seem like a tired old trope, wealthy, older, worldly guy pursues a young, inexperienced girl, but this book is SO much more!! I was addicted from the the first page. This book has humor, witty dialogue, a great story and THE most amazing, prolonged sex scenes EVER. \n Of course things grow complicated and there are many secrets between these two. Em might be a threat to Joseph\'s business, so will he be willing to give that up? They both push each other\'s boundaries and the conclusion was perfect. This book is a very explicit, very adult story that kept me riveted from beginning to end. It is a page-turner all the way!

Sexy and very engaging, Sacked is a fast-paced, refreshingly funny story. \n Jen Frederick\'s writing is like a breath of fresh air. This story is refreshing and verrra sexy while also sweet and funny at the same time. I LOVED it! Knox Masters is a college football superstar and Ellie is a transfer student who just might be his perfect match. She\'s smart, athletic, understands the game of football...but wait, she\'s hiding a secret that could jeopardize both their futures. And well, Knox is a virgin so there\'s that, too. \n I often find that New Adult books don\'t hold enough romance or sexy times for me but SACKED has all of that PLUS MORE. It\'s a steamy, well-written story and it provides very knowing glimpses into the world of American college football. Plus I absolutely LOVED the witty back-and-forth between Knox and Ellie! And the fact that Knox is a virgin, well, I am usually a Doubting Thomas but this storyline just works. When he and Ellie finally get together, the slow-burn build up is totally worth it and the scenes between these two are off the charts hot!! \n SACKED is a sexy, light, fast-paced read, and it is not just for fans of sports romance. There\'s plenty of humor and a little bit of drama and it all adds up to a terrific read. Knox Masters could not possibly be any hotter and I\'m really looking forward to more books about the supporting characters.

Her boyfriend from a summer abroad in Europe is also in Rome. Marcelo has never forgotten Avery, and and has always wondered why she left Europe that summer so suddenly so many years before. \n Avery has always played by others\' rules: she married because it was the right thing to do, led a certain life because it was emptied of her, but here in Rome, with her friend Daisy, she is really free for the first time in her life to be her own woman.

This is not a \"typical\" Mia Sheridan story but it is magical, enchanting and irresistible nonetheless. Two very strong, sexy and damaged lead characters make this a very memorable story. \n The story begins in a very gripping way: Kira is desperate, almost homeless, and immediately propositions Grayson Hawthorn with an almost-insane scheme: she must marry in order to gain access to an inheritance from her grandmother. Grayson, too, his desperate: he is about to lose his precious winery, and has reached a dead end due to his prison record. \n Grayson is sexy, handsome, yet aloof and emotionally closed off. He has been hurt by those he trusted and loved. Kira is also emotionally damaged, but yet she still remains warm and engaging and filled with hope. She is young and impulsive but truly believes marrying Grayson is her only hope. \n I fell in love with Grayson. He is cruel to most people but when you learn about his past, well, your heart will break for him. And Kira was betrayed by those she trusted most, which could have left her cruel and emotionally cut-off but she still retains the capacity to love. \n \"In Vino Veritas. In wine there is truth. In love there is truth.\" \n Grayson\'s Vow is set in and around Napa, California, one of my most favorite places in the world!! I absolutely loved the scenery and the setting. There is also an engaging cast of supporting characters in this book which I loved. There is an air of magic to this book, which adds a bit of whimsy and lightens the emotional heaviness of the plot. There is PLENTY of steam and Grayson is just YUMMY. Who doesn\'t love a bad boy with a heart of gold? \n This book is very different from Ms. Sheridan\'s other books, and gets into some overly-dramatic scenes near the end of the story. I still found this to be a beautiful story about the power of love and acceptance and honesty. And the EPILOGUE...OMG!! A 10+ which had be sobbing happy tears for Grayson and Kira. \n (ARC provided by the author with thanks.)'),

I can live with instalove and instalust, but the main characters got together way too early in the story for me to feel any connection between them whatsoever. The storyline is clever and could have made a good book, but there was just too much thrown in to create any real depth to the characters or to the situations. There is a major plot twist at the end that is just completely and utterly unbelievable. I give the author credit for some interesting ideas, but this book is in need of a good editor. Also there is a wrong word that is used during a crucial scene that hopefully was fixed in the final version. I\'ll give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that is was because if not, it completely changed the tone of the scene. ( Usually I purchase the finished book but I didn\'t in this case.)

I won\'t ever forget it. \n At once magical and painfully realistic, F*CK LOVE is like nothing you\'ve read before. It has some similarities to one of all-time favorite series, The Love Me With Lies books, but it is different, unique and wonderfully, beautifully hopeful and cynical at the same time. Can that be? Tarry Fisher pulls it off with one of the most surprising books I\'ve ever had the pleasure of reading. \n The story begins with a completely disorienting scene that sets the tone for the rest of the book. \n Kit hit me out of nowhere.

For the last eight weeks I\'ve been living it. \n Yes, the main character Helena has a dream, in which she is living a life completely different from her current path. What will she do with it? Will her dream become her reality? In true Tarryn Fisher form, the author has created a kind, beautiful, smart and very quirky girl, who aches for what she cannot have. \n \"We have something, Helena. In another life, it would have been a beautiful something.\" That hurts. God, does it. I\'ve seen that life. He doesn\'t even know what he\'s talking about. In his mind, I\'m just some possibility that could have been, but in my mind, he\'s the only possibility. \n F*ck Love is a wildly unpredictable book that is poignant and uplifting, funny and tragic, and will take you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I can\'t help but wonder how much of this story (if any) is based on real-life events. And yes, I imagine Tarryn Fisher herself as Helena. To me, it is a perfect fit! Don\'t miss F*ck Love, it is absolutely one of my favorite books of 2016. \n Favorite Quote: \n Be gentle with yourself. Embrace the lows so that you can more effectively enjoy the highs. Love the fight. Love it so much, and let it save you when your emotional muscles have become soft. \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.'),
(229, 28, 19, 4, 'Butterfly Dreams is the first book I have read by A. Meredith Walters. I know she is a favorite of many readers, so I was thrilled to have the chance to read this book. I adored this story! It is a witty, fast-paced and yes, very emotional story about coming to terms with your life and facing your own mortality. \n The author has created two very lively and memorable characters in Corin and Beckett. Corin is obsessed with her physical health, convinced that she has a multitude of undiagnosed ailments. She does suffer from panic attacks, but she is sure she is going to die at any minute from a heart attack. \n She finds her way to a support group for heart patients where she meets Beckett, who has actually suffered a nbear-fatal heart attack and has had his regular day-to-day activities sharply curtailed. He is in the prime of his life but because of his brush with death, now sees everything differently. \n Corin is morbid and morose while Beckett is warm and funny and outgoing. She looks back on her life while he looks forward: \n \"Stop thinking about your life in increments. Seconds. Minutes. Days. Look at the bigger picture and embrace whatever time you have. Don\'t look constantly toward the end. Enjoy the right now.\" \n This story is very funny and balances the serious subjects perfectly with witty banter and sexy times between the two main characters. I really enjoyed this story and recommend it for all fans of New Adult romance. While the conclusion is a bit predictable, the wit, sarcasm and solid writing make Butterfly Dreams a very enjoyable read. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(230, 29, 10, 5, '\"I wished I could see myself through his eyes. Then again, Damian never looked at me with his eyes. He looked at me with his soul.\" \n Totally unexpected story by the incredible Leylah Attar! Dark and emotional but ultimately passionate and hopeful. A must-read. I couldn\'t put it down and read it almost in one sitting. \n After I read 53 LETTERS FOR MY LOVER, I fell in love with Leylah Attar\'s writing. It is rich, mature, and lush. I couldn\'t wait until her newest book and was completely intrigued by the synopsis for THE PAPER SWAN. Not much of the plot is given away, for good reason. There is not much I can add to the stellar reviews for this book, other than to say that Ms. Attar has a unique voice and an incredible gift with words. Nothing prepared me for the emotions that I felt while reading The Paper Swan. The characters, the plot, the epilogue - all perfect, unique and gloriously realized. \n I like a good dark read as much as I love a sexy contemporary romance and this book actually blends these two genres together. My attention has been wandering as of late and I have struggled to finish a lot of the books I have been reading. However, I read The Paper Swan from cover to cover (do Kindles even have \"covers\"?) and basically ignored real life until I finished this magnificent story. I don\'t know how to describe this story other than to say everyone has some redeeming quality, no matter how evil they act, and those whom you think are above criticism might have skeletons in their closet and may not be what they seem. \n The story is filled with tons of suprising twists, along with a stunning story of survival, redemption and forgiveness Nothing can prepare you for this story or for the depth of emotion you will feel. The dialogue is witty and intelligent and the heroine is smart and loving and very capable. \n Without giving too much away, this is a story about love, passion, family, hate, revenge and survival. And devotion. \n \"We are stars with flaws that still sparkle and shine. We always strive, always want, always have more questions than answers, but there are moments like these, full of magic and contentment, when souls get a glimpse of the divine and quite simply, lose their breath.\" \n The Paper Swan is one of the most unique books I\'ve ever read. Based on the synopsis, I went into thinking I was getting one thing, but was surprised with what this book was actually about. There is much more I want to say about this book, but it\'s hard to without giving anything away. This is just one of those books that it\'s better to go into blind. The fact that you don\'t know what to expect makes The Paper Swan even better. \n I will say that The Paper Swan is an incredibly written book with tons of plot twists and smart characters, The story spans a good amount of time and that adds a richness to the relationship between the two main protagonists. \n This book is captivating, intense, sexy and funny all in one book. I am still thinking about The Paper Swan weeks after I finished. Simply put, The Paper Swan was absolutely amazing. I can\'t recommend it highly enough. 5 fantastic stars!!! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(231, 29, 47, 5, '4.5 Explosive Stars!! \n OMG this book!!! A dirty-talking baseball star who quotes Shakespeare? YES, PLEASE! \n \"I can\'t decide how to f* you, he says. \"I want to take you in every position. I want to f* you like an animal and a saint. I want to keep you on the brink for an hour and take four orgasms from you. I can\'t do it all tonight. I\'m kind of pissed about that.\" \n Hardball is sexy, heartfelt, exciting, funny, steamy and addictive. I LOVED Dash Wallace! He is seemingly perfect, gorgeous, a gifted athlete, but he is actually filled with compulsions and must adhere to a strict routine at all times. His baseball career and his sanity depend on it. I fell totally in love with this damaged man. \n The Synopsis to this book doesn\'t really show the depth of emotion in this book. There is so much more than just the sizzling romance between Dash and Vivian. There is the amazingly detailed descriptions of the game of baseball. There are the wonderful supporting characters, including Vivian\'s elderly father. There is the constant battle within Dash\'s head over his ADHD and the obsessive way he deals with routine and his superstitions. \n Vivian has only had one boyfriend in her life so Dash hits her like a freight train. OMG, their scenes together are on FIRE!!! CD Reiss writes some of the best erotic romance around. And set against the backdrop of Los Angeles and baseball, well, Hardball is just perfection. \n I LOVED the imperfection of these characters. Vivian and Dash are both insecure in their own way. Vivian doesn\'t think she\'s good enough or sexy enough for a glamorous baseball player like Dash. He is battling with his own internal demons. These characters captured my heart. And kudos to CD Reiss for the fabulously detailed descriptions of the game of baseball. \n I am a huge fan of CD Reiss but even if you\'ve never read one of her books, give Hardball a try. It is glorious. \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.'),
(232, 29, 47, 4, '4.5 STARS!! \n Ethan Dexter is SMOKING HOT and sweet as sugar - my favorite combination!! \n \"Just say the word and you can have me, Fiona.\" \n AS you can read from the synopsis, Ethan \"Dex\" Dexter is a pro football player who also happens to be a virgin. The author did an fabulous job with this part of the story (it is a romance, after all) and I totally believed the sweet-hot feelings that Dex and Fiona had for each other. First and foremost, this is a love story with fantastic steamy sex scenes and perfectly witty and funny banter between the characters. \n Dex and Fi met years earlier and he has never forgotten her. She is a smart and feisty woman who is not so sure she wants to jump into a relationship with a professional football player who also happens to live in an other city. I loved how Dex practically wore his heart on his sleeve, which to me, made him all the more irresisitbile. Ms. Callihan writes loving, sexy men, and Dex is no exception. And the beard, tattoos and, ahem, piercings only added to his allure. \n \"I want you badly enough to put all my cards on the table, show who I really am. So I guess it\'s your play now.\" \n I read this book almost non-stop and adored each and every character! Dex and Fi went through some difficult times and not all was sunshine and roses for them. The Game Plan is perfect for when you want a very sexy but light and fast-paced sports romance that will make you laugh out loud and TOTALLY swoon over the story\'s hero. I also loved how the author portrayed the trials and tribulations of living life in the public eye, and how Dex and Fi dealt with the very public intrusion into their private lives. \n Kristen Callihan has quickly become one of my favorite writers. Enjoy sexy Dex!! \n Favorite Quote: \n \"I\'ve been waiting two years for you to see me.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(233, 29, 82, 4, '4.5 STARS!! \n \"Freedom is so close I can taste its bitterness on the tip of my tongue.: \n What a stunning story!! I adored this tortured tale of Low and Poesy, two star-crossed lovers who spend much of the book on the run from the authorities after a string of bank robberies. It is a tribute to the talent of Mary Elizabeth that you actually feel tremendous sympathy for Low, the poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks whose life seems doomed from the first page. \n Low has the misfortune to have a criminal for a father and to be dirt-poor. A petty crime lands him in prison with hardened criminals who teach him how to rob banks. When he is released, he tries desperately to live on the right side of the law. But poverty, hunger and sheer desperation drive him to a string of crimes, with the loyal Poesy right by his side. She is absolutely devoted to him. \n \"I\'m here,\" she chose in a for-sure tone. \"We did this together, and anything we do together is right, Low.\" \n I spent most of this book on the edge of my seat, in a constant state of anxiety for the handsome, sad Low and his beautiful Poesy. He is desperate to live a simple, normal life. Low is not at all greedy, but he just wants to be able to eat, help Poesy with school and help his own family. They seem doomed from the start but they overcome so many obstacles that I was cheering for them throughout the book. \n LOW is a fast-paced, very gritty story that is incredibly addictive. This was my first book by Mary Elizabeth and I am in love with her writing style!! I loved LOW and I hope for more about these two unforgettable characters. \n Favorite quote: \n \"I can\'t be anywhere else other than with you, Lowen,\" she says softly. \"No matter what happens, we have to stay together.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(234, 29, 19, 5, '4.5 - 5 DARK STARS!! \n Freedom. \n I had it. \n But then, I lost it. \n This is Pepper Winters are her VERY darkest, very close in tone to the fantastic Monsters in the Dark Series but even darker!! Be warned that the first half of this book is quite grim, and follows the imprisonment of young Tasmin (now called Pim) at the hands of a sadistic monster. There is scene after scene of graphic physical abuse (along with sexual abuse.) The Indebted Series (one of my favorite series ever) might not even be as dark as Pennies. As much as I absolutely adore Q and Jethro, I have high hopes for the mysterious and ruthless Elder Prest!! But don\'t be fooled, he is as black-hearted as they come and explicitly warns Pim that he is no hero. \n I wasn\'t a nice man. \n I was a tormentor. A killer. A thief. \n And I wanted to steal her courage drop by fucking drop. \n After all this darkness in Pennies, I just KNOW that Pepper Winters will craft an unforgettable romance between Prest and Pim, as only she can do. After all, a very wise author told me that you \"gotta start dark to enjoy the light.\" \n The writing is excellent as always, very suspenseful and very descriptive and yet never revealing too much about Prest or about the future storyline. The ending left me hopeful and wanting more. I can\'t wait to finish this dark journey with Prest and Pim! \n (With thanks to the author for a review copy.)'),
(235, 29, 39, 4, '4 - 4.5 Swoony, Second-Chance Stars! \n Funny, refreshing and very sexy, Cocky Bastard was a pleasant surprise! I loved it! I\'m obsessed with Chance. The story very fast-paced and engaging and the dialogue witty and filled with double entendres. \n \"... If I change your tire, you let me ride with you.\" \n \"Ride with me?\" \n \"Ride me, yes.\" \n \"What did you just say?\" \n \"You\'re hearing things.\" \n I loved how Chance showed Aubrey how to loosen up and live in the moment. And I absolutely loved Aubrey\'s character, she\'s smart, and has amazing chemistry with Chance. \n This story is very sexy but has lots of warmth and heart. I really enjoyed it! And I\'ll never look at Pixy Stix or bobbleheads the same way again. If you are looking for a great road trip story with a helluva hot Aussie, you\'ll love Cocky Bastard!');

(236, 29, 87, 4, 'Loved the newest book from one of my favorite authors! This book has it all: world-famous rock stars, SMOKING hot sex, and a very engaging storyline. And we get to visit with some of our favorite Sinners. \n I have devoured all of Ms. Cunning\'s previous books, I mean, who doesn\'t love the mega-hot rockers of the Sinners on Tour series? Those were among the first books I read when I started reading romance. And the new Exodus End book doesn\'t disappoint in the steam department, this book has everything and more in the sexytimes department. \n Ms. Cunning once again writes an immensely readable and incredibly HAWT story, this time involving the virginal and very sweet Toni who is hired to write an interactive biography of the band. Something about her attracts Logan, the sexy, Mr. Hot Rocker, who actually finds her innocence an incredible turn-on! Their scenes together are, um, breathtaking and will leave you with a new respect for there writing talents of Olivia Cunning. \n There is a very sweet story involving Toni\'s family life, she is leaving behind her special needs sister to go on tour with Exodus End. Her mother is the owner of publishing company that Toni works for andI loved the tension between her mother and Toni over the company. There is lots of drama involving a co-worker who does\'t have Toni\'s best interests at heart. \n Our favorite Sinners all make appearances here and it was great meeting up with them again, \n But the heart of this story is the wonderful sexual awakening of Toni and the hands of Logan, I mean, Olivia Cunning can write a sex scene like no other! Toni is very endearing and not your typical flashy, sexy groupie that Logan would normally go for. Their scenes together also have a lot of heart to them. I adored this first book in the Exodus End series and I can\'t wait to read about the other band members! I hope there will be more! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(237, 29, 22, 5, 'WOW. Kristen Ashley does it again with Logan and Millie\'s story. Just when I think I can\'t love this author any more, she takes my breath away with yet another absolutely magnificent book. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!! \n I am a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and Walk Through Fire might be one of my all-time favorites in this genre. Everything I love about Ms. Ashley\'s writing is here: an older couple, a smart but damaged woman, an Alpha male and lots and lots of ridiculously hot sex. I could go on and on about the gorgeous moments in this book but really, you should just read it and experience the emotions for yourself. I got the same feelings in this book as I did in Soaring, and while it takes a lot for me to cry while reading a book, I cried plenty while reading Millie and Logan\'s story. \n You learn right off the bat that Logan was Millie\'s first true love and that things ended suddenly between them years earlier. Jump forward and Millie runs into Logan and just the sound of his voice stuns her and she feels compelled to explain to him what happened decades before. He has been married and had children but Millie has spent the years alone, although successful in her business and very close to her own family. Logan, who hasn\'t seemed to have gotten over Millie walking away from him, is still bitter and is very, very cruel to Millie when she tries to explain her behavior to him: \n \"I\'m done not because I\'m done but because there\'s nothing left of me to burn. You have it all! You\'ve always had it all! I gave up everything so you could have it all! Please! God! Leave me to my nothing!\" \n I don\'t want to spoil the story but you will probably guess Millie\'s reasons for suddenly breaking up with Logan pretty early on in the story. As bitter as Logan is towards Millie, you know that eventually these two will have their HEA but their path there is both beautiful and very bittersweet at the same time. \n There is a mature aspect to this story which drew me in from the first page. These aren\'t kids or twenty-somethings, these characters are all adults, with their own kids, careers, families, and relationships to deal with. i absolutely loved how Logan\'s ex-wife was portrayed in this book and how Millie interacted with her. Oh, and did I mention the sex in this book is completely hot?? Because of course, you know that it is!! I don\'t often re-read books but I have already re-read parts of Walk Through Fire while I wait (not so) patiently for the next book from Ms. Ashley. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(238, 29, 39, 3, '3.5 Stars!! \n Lauren Dane writes an super-sexy story, with a couple who have some piercings in very, um, key places! \n Ms. Dane has written some of my favorite and sexiest contemporary romance novels (The Brown Family series is a favorite and highly recommended - they are totally addictive.) Opening Up is the first in her new Ink and Chrome series. The plot is light, steamy, funny, fast-paced and pretty much angst-free. \n I couldn\'t wait to dive into this book and I read it one sitting. PJ is a young, strong-willed woman who breaks free from her overbearing family and ventures out on her own in the world off body shop painting. She meets Asa, who is older, totally domineering and sex-on-a-stick. He accepts her for who she is and their sex is, to put it mildly, off the charts. Think multiple piercings, sexy tattoos and passionate car sex! \n \"You\'re defiling her in your head right now, aren\'t you?\" \n Hell yes. \n There is nothing too dramatic or earth shattering in this book. I loved the chemistry between PJ and Asa and you will need a fan for their scenes together. OPENING UP is the perfect summertime read to take to the pool or beach, and the secondary characters are just as enjoyable! (I cannot wait for Duke, Asa\'s friend, to get his story in FALLING UNDER, coming out in August. Hello! Can you say huge, tattooed and sexy?) All in all, OPENING UP is a passionate, funny, dirty and light summer read with a HEA. Enjoy! \n \"Wait. I want to see you put the condom on over the piercing. I should know this. For future reference.\" \n I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.'),
(239, 29, 19, 4, 'Sweet and unexpectedly romantic and SEXY!! I love a story with a single mom and The Offer has that plus much more. I loved all the characters in this book, plus Steph and Lident make appearances as well. However, you do not need to have read The Pact to enjoy this story. Nicola is living on the edge, trying to make a home for her daughter Ava but struggling to make ends meet since Ava\'s dad is absent. Along comes Bram, who seems to be quite the sexy player, confident and bold. \n But Bram isn\'t what he seems, there\'s more than meets the eye here, and after some amazing chemsitry and hot sex, Nicole finds herself falling for Bram. There is no Insta-love here, Nicola and Bram\'s banter is great and she does not instantly fall for his moves. \n I loved Ava, and Ms. Halle writes the scenes with her with great compassion and understanding. Ava is adorable. But sexy-talking Bram is the star here, and I really liked how he had many different sides to his personality. This is a classic contemporary romance, with modern characters, genuine dialogue and very realistic situations. \n There is a wonderful Epilogue plus a suprising twist which was all very satisfying. The Offer is a great summer read, full of sexy times, great banter and very sympathetic characters. \n (ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(240, 29, 68, 5, 'PRIEST is a wonderfully dirty, very adult and immensely readable book from Sierra Simone. EVERYTHING about this story worked for me, from the mostly male POV, to the smoking hot sex scenes and the very sympathetic characters. \n No surprises in the storyline: Father Tyler Bell is tempted by the smart and beautiful Poppy Danforth and they begin a torrid affair that sorely tests his faith and his commitment to the priesthood. I immediately connected with both of these characters and sympathized with Tyler\'s deep yearning and longing for Poppy: \n \"I was supposed to be a shepherd of the flock, not the wolf. \n Not the wolf who had woken up this morning grinding his hips into the mattress because he\'d had a very intense dream with Poppy and her carnal sins in a starring role. Guilt wormed through me at the memory.\" \n Poor Father Bell! Everything he worked so hard for was in jeopardy. I absolutely loved his internal dialogue and the backstory that led him to join the priesthood. If anyone was ever NOT cut out to take a vow of celibacy, it was certainly Tyler Bell, but he really loves his parish and congregants. I also thought the black humor worked really well here, as a counterbalance to the fairly serious themes of the book: \n \"I could do this. There was life after fucking up, after all, even for those who lived without fucking.\" \n Both Tyler and Poppy realize quickly that they not only can they not keep their hands off each other, but they both have very deep feelings for each other. Tyler truly cared about Poppy, and he was risking everything for her. Their scenes together are just...irresistible! \n \"Was I only telling myself I cared about her spiritual development, so that I could be near her? No, I decided. That for sure wasn\'t true. It was just that the actual truth was so much worse. I cared about her as a person, as a soul, and I wanted to fuck her, and that was the recipe for something much worse than carnal sin. It was a recipe for falling in love.\" \n PRIEST is an incredibly enjoyable, sexy, and yes, sometimes even funny story. I plan to read the author\'s other books because I loved this one so much. PRIEST is simply outstanding! \n Favorite quotes: \n \"Pursue righteousness, the author of Timothy said. But did righteousness carry a bottle of Macallan 12 in her hand? Because Poppy did.\" \n \"Be good be good be good, I told myself as I approached her. Don\'t jump her bones. Don\'t fantasize about fucking her tits.

(241, 29, 32, 4, 'Skye Warren is one of my go-to dark romance authors. Each of her stories is richly detailed, deeply felt and intensely sexy. Better When It Hurts is no exception. Although I have not read Love the Way You Lie, I was able to jump right in to Blue and Lola\'s story here. Both are very damaged characters who had to learn how to survive on their own from a young age. \n These two have a long past together which is why Blue insists on acting as security on the nights she dances at the club where they both work. Lola tries to put on a tough exterior but her toughness is just an act that is in part driven by guilt over what happened between the two of them when they were foster kids. This is a gritty story but as with all Skye Warren books, the sex scenes are totally hot and very, very intense. \n Lola is not always the most likable character but she is very real and just trying to do what she has to in order to survive. Blue is totally Alpha, sexy, domineering and despite the hard exterior, is a guy with a heart. These two have incredible chemistry. If you like grittier stories with lots of erotic scenes and the right touch of romance, then Better When It Hurts is for you! Another great story from Skye Warren. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy have become two of my favorite authors!! \n I read a fair amount of M/M romance books, so I approached HIM with a wary eye. Would it have enough steam for me? Would the two heroes only dance around their attraction for each other, but never really get down to business? Would the dialogue be witty enough to hold my pathetically short attention span? \n The answer to all these questions is a resounding YES!! \n Because I adored Elle Kennedy\'s Off Campus series and loved Sarina Bowen\'s The Shameless Hour, I was thrilled to be able to read their collaboration together. And once I started reading HIM, I literally could NOT put this book down! Jamie Canning and Ryan \'Wes\' Wesley were perfectly real characters to me and the writing style so seamless, that I could not tell which author wrote which chapter, scene or verse. Even if you\'re new to the M/M genre, I highly recommend this book for the witty banter, sexy times and catchy plot. Two hot hockey players? Yes please!! \n Jamie and Wes were childhood friends who lost touch after a youthful incident that caused an unfortunate miscommunication. Lo and behold, they run into each other years later and both realize that they have been the \"missing link\" in each other\'s lives. But does Jamie just want to be friends with Wes? Set among the world of college hockey, HIM delivers the perfect amount of hot, dirty, sweet emotion as both Wes and Jamie learn to come to terms with their true feelings. Wes has always loved Jamie and finds it difficult to keep their relationship platonic. \n \"As I watch Jamie Canning stop another dizzying slap shot. As I admire the grace and deadly precision with which he moves. \n My weakness is him.\" \n I absolutely LOVED how the authors wrote a seamless story that perfectly illustrated the difficulties that gay sports players must face. Wes and Jamie were perfectly suited for each other, even if Jamie at first was reluctant to admit his true feelings for Wes. And Wes, on the other hand, is a total commitment-phone, never allowing anyone to get too close, and hopping from meaningless encounter to another. \n \"The fact that he\'d been the first guy I ever loved and the one who made me face some terrifying things about myself...well, all that will go unsaid.\" \n HIM is a feel-good sports romance that happens to feature two fabulously sexy male protagonists. It is perfect for die-hard readers of M/M romance as well as for readers who are new to the genre. I adored this book and hope that Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy collaborate on many more books in the future! \n (I received an ARC in return for an honest review.)'),
(243, 29, 39, 4, 'SMOKING hot, funny and surprisingly endearing! Elle Kennedy writes the wittiest banter around. I really loved this story and Dean is absolutely irresistible! \n The Score follows two characters from Elle\'s earlier books. Allie is a drama major and Dean is studying law. Allie may be my favorite Elle Kennedy heroine so far! She is smart, funny, and yes, emotional. At first I thought she was a little weak, coming off of her break-up with her boyfriend, but this girl knows what she wants and isn\'t afraid to go after it! \n And DEAN...well, lets just say he started off with a bang for me, literally, plus I am one of those readers who loves a cocky guy! Dean comes from a wealthy family and he has certain expectations placed on him...what courses he\'ll study, what profession he\'ll go into...his whole life is mapped out for him. But he is HILARIOUS (hello, Twilight reference?) and on top of his sexiness, he is a sweet, caring guy. When he started coaching the kids\' hockey team... well, let\'s just say I was a goner at that point. Oh, and did I mention Dean is a dirty-talker? YES, PLEASE! \n \"I though you said you didn\'t want to salsa dance. And Dean De Laurentis only does what he wants, remember?\" \n He shrugs. \"I am doing what I want.\" \n My eyebrows knit together as I wait for him to clarify. \n \"I\'m making you happy.\" \n Allie and Dean seem mismatched but guess what, they fit together perfectly! What\'s starts off as a sex-with-no-strings relationship of course turns into much more...but that is the beauty of Elle Kennedy\'s writing. There is nothing predictable here and there are tons of twists and turns along the way to Dean and Allie\'s HEA. With lots of witty banter and funny dialogue, smoking-hot sex and a little angst, THE SCORE is a fresh and modern romance that I devoured. I adored Dean and Allie together and can\'t wait for the next book! (What? Did you say Tucker?) \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

MAKE ME is pure Tess Bailey gold! Abby and Russell\'s story is an enjoyable, delicious book, written as always in the trademark Tess Bailey style of dirty-talking Alphas with a healthy dose of reality, humor and solid storyline. \n I was hooked from the hilarious opening line of this book. Russell is a blue-collar construction worker who thinks he will never be good enough for Abby, who comes from a wealthy family but is insanely attracted to Russell. She doesn\'t quite know how to move their friendship to the next level. Russell, on the other hand, fantasizes constantly about the irresistible Abby and is driven by the need to protect her. Will these two ever be able to move their relationship past the dreaded friend zone? Tessa Bailey writes some of the best growly, sexy Alpha heroes and Russell is no exception. As with all of Ms. Bailey\'s books, you will need to have a cold shower ready while reading MAKE ME, but the sexiness is mixed in with the perfect amount of extremely witty banter and memorable characters.

Dakota goes along with Levi, Gunner and Emmy Sue on a trip for Levi and Gunner\'s motocross bike races. Levi is HOT but Dakota stays away from relationships. So this trip is perfect for the both of them: a hot hook-up with no promise of anything permanent. I loved Dakota\'s character: she is smart, strong-willed and not afraid to go after what she wants But when the road trip ends, will she be able to walk away from Levi? \n Dakota is from an unconventional family and I love how her free spirit shines through in this book. Levi is immediately attracted to her spirit but he is very honest about not wanting anything more than sex while they are on the road. He doesn\'t \"do\" relationships either. But is he ever HOT!! \n \"Sunshine,\" Levi leans over to me, resting his hand on the inside of my thigh, right below the frayed hem of my shorts, \"I promise I want to learn all about your family. They sound cool as fuck--especially the part about the weed farm--but can we get back to where you said motocross is driving fast and doing stupid, crazy-ass stunts while flying through the air? \'Cause if you\'re gonna be my girl on this trip, we need to give you a crash course tonight in all things motocross, so you can truly appreciate my awesomeness when you see me in action.\" \n These two have some great banter and the action scenes are incredible! Although this is the second book in a series, it can absolutely be read as a standalone. If you love a great new adult romance with plenty of sizzle and smart, witty banter, then you will LOVE FLAME!'),

This book is pure fun, a feel-good, sexy read with a HEA and a Cinderella feel to the story. It is a modern tale of a small-town girl trying to make it in the Big Apple, living on a shoestring budget but trying in the best Mary-Tyler-Moore fashion \"to make it on her own.\" \n Jo is a scrappy heroine, and thrilled to land her dream job with a famous fashion house in New York City. Of course her boss is Mr. Sexy Julian Lefray, and the sparks fly between these two right from the get-up. I love a good male POV and Ms. Grey writes a great one! Plus, this book has the just right amount of sex, it was a great \"palate cleanser\" in between the super-steamy and graphic contemporary romance and erotic books I normally read. \n This book is great if you are looking for a fun, light, sexy and witty book, with great banter between the hero and heroine and some really funny dialogue. It is a modern tale of love and sex and firendship in the big city and I highly recommend it. You can\'t go wrong with a book by R.S. Grey! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Boner made my heart race and captured my soul! \n \"You reminded me that there\'s still magic,\" he whispered roughly. \"That there are things of wonder still left to experience.\" \n I am a HUGE fan of MC Romance books and Cat Porter is at the top of my list of favorite authors in this genre! Lock & Key, the first book in this series, remains one of my all-time favorite books. Random & Rare contented the experience of her absolutely flawless writing and now we have the third book in the series, which is Boner and Jill\'s story. \n Boner is a total bad-ass, who has been attracted to Jill for a long time but won\'t act on it. He\'s too old for her; she isn\'t sure she wants to go back to club life again; etc. etc. Jill had been with Catch, another biker and the father of her child, and it ended badly. But who can resist Boner, the sexy biker with a painful past? And how he got his road name...well, you\'ll have to read for yourself! It\'s not what you think. I fell in love with him and hoped that Jill could help him overcome his demons. \n \"Was I only pieces patched together by a leather vest?\" \n Even though Boner think Jill is off-limits, he offers her his protection and let\'s just say things progress from there. At first, their \"relationship\" is just for show but since this is a romance after all, they both quickly come to realize they have real feelings for each other. And the Victoria\'s Secret scene? Oh my God!!! My favorite. \n I loved reading about Boner\'s painful past and the action scenes are fantastic. While this doesn\'t knock out Lock & Key as one of my all-time favorite books, it is a fantastic, sexy, fast-paced and passionate story which I enjoyed immensely. The Epilogue was superb! All in all, Iron & Bone is another must-read book from the incredibly talented Cat Porter. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(248, 30, 82, 4, '3.5-4 stars, interesting idea that had some exciting moments but overall I had a few issues that interfered with my enjoyment of the story. I did like the main characters and the New York setting. The writing is very good but I felt the story completely sugar-coated the jail setting; this is a fairy-tale, romanticized view of prison life. I also felt the ending was unrealistic with respect to Carter dealing with a corporate matter (I don\'t want to give away any spoilers here.) Most readers would not be bothered by that turn of events but I had a tough time with it. I did really appreciate the development of the characters and the overall story idea. I had high hopes for this book and for that reason I will definitely give the author\'s next books a try.'),

I had the great pleasure of reading an early copy of Maldeamores and I haven\'t stopped thinking about it. \n Heed the warnings on this one because Maldeamores is unlike amy book I\'ve read. Belen and Luciano are star-crossed lovers, fiercely in love but forced to deny their true feelings for each other. Like Mara\'s other books, I felt anxious, emotional, distraught and fascinated by these two characters and their tumultuous journey. The writing is stunning, sharp and incredibly erotic and the characters richly detailed. I was drawn into their world and was stunned by the turn of the events. These two are truly \"lovesick\" and simply cannot live apart from each other. \n There are some very graphic and steamy scenes in this book, but they fit in with the story and add fuel to the deep emotional bond Belen and Luciano share. If you like to be challenged and thrilled when you read, then Maldeamores is the book for you. It is not an easy story but I loved the rollercoaster ride of emotions! Mara White is a talent to watch and I hope she will keep on writing these complex, sexy stories. \n \"When the pen falls into our hands, we can\'t erase the past. \n All we\'re allowed is the chance to create a new ending.\"'),

The blurb of MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE intrigued me and made me think of one of my favorite movies, Sliding Doors. While this book was not all that I had hoped for, it is nonetheless a well-written, thought-provoking story about the consequences of our actions, fate and destiny. \n Taylor Jenkins Reid brings a unique and fresh voice to the idea that our soul mates are out there, and that our choices lead us to our own realities. Both parallel stories in this book were engaging, REAL, and very original. The characters are all very relatable and some of their stories more poignant than others. \n \"I know there may be universes out there where I made different choices and they led me somewhere else, led me to someone else. And my heart breaks for every single version of me that didn\'t end up with you.\" \n Our heroine Hannah takes two widely divergent paths, as does her best friend Gabby. I did feel an overriding sense of sadness while reading this book, which, happily, was replaced by joy by the end. MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE is a very thoughtful and interesting book, which will make you think about your choices in life, and whether fate ever really plays a part in our lives. Is everything all mapped out, occurring anyway no matter what our choices might be? There\'s lots to chew on here and I will say that I was totally surprised by the ending of this book. \n I would have like a little more detail about some of the more meaningful events in this book. However, much of this story seems aimed at twenty-somethings who will very much enjoy Hannah\'s journey. I did feel that some important details were missing, but overall, both the writing and the story were very intriguing and fresh. \n I read this in one sitting and I will definitely grab the author\'s other books now. Love, loss, family, friendship, loyalty -- they are all covered here and I think this is the perfect summertime read.'),

My thought when finishing was, \"Now what do I read?!\" This is one of my top favorite series EVER. I am truly obsessed with this author and this story. Jonah and Vivienne are incredibly written characters, filled with depth and raw emotion. This is a very adult story, dealing with very adult subjects. With that said, these book are among the most highly erotic stories I have ever read. \n This series is not for everyone, but if you like sexy, edgy, mature stories, then definitely give these books a try. Lilah Pace\'s writing captivated me and drew me into Jonah and Vivienne\'s story like very few authors can do. While the subject may seem very taboo, I found these books to be as much an exploration of women\'s sexuality as they are \"forbidden\" erotic romance. These stories take you on an emotional journey that is sensual, enthralling and addictive, to say the least. \n BEGGING FOR IT is the conclusion to the series and picks up right where the first book ended. They must be read in order. These two characters are absolutely unforgettable, and I could not really fathom how they were going to make their very unorthodox relationship work. Jonah struggles with his own seemingly-insurmountable dark fantasies, while Vivienne also struggles to come to terms with her own deep-seated fears, as well as her very dysfunctional family. I literally raced through this book, fearful that the author was not going to give these two perfectly damaged souls the conclusion they were worthy of. I felt tremendous empathy for both of these characters and was deeply satisfied with the fantastic conclusion to their stories. I can\'t say enough about these books. They are thought-provoking, emotional and incredibly readable. \n \"We don\'t get better; we don\'t fix everything that\'s broken. We just learn how to work around the broken bits. How to do the best we can with what we have, and who we are.\" \n I am completely OBSESSED with this author and cannot wait for whatever books she might have planned for the future. I hope there are more books under the name Lilah Pace - I will read anything she writes! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(253, 30, 55, 5, 'WOW!! I don\'t even know where to begin with this book. Lilah Pace has written an absolutely perfect story, filled with erotic moments, thrills, emotion and a gripping plot. Each and every character is perfectly drawn, richly detailed and essential to the story. I can\'t say enough about this book and the author stalking has already begun. Who is this Lilah Pace and why has she enthralled me so? \n Vivienne is an art student at the University of Texas - Austin who has rape fantasies but they are rooted in a traumatic past event, and the many sessions with her therapist bring the story to light and perfectly frame the rest of the book. While some readers might be turned off by this story, I found it to be sexy, dramatic and addictive. She meets Dr. Jonah Marks, a gorgeous, brilliant and enigmatic professor in another department at UT, and through a series of very thrilling events, they begin a series of encounters. Certainly \"relationship\" might be too strong a word for what they do. But I can guarantee that you have never read scenes as hot as the scenes between Jonah and Vivi. \n \"How did this man with the power to terrify me also become the one person who truly makes me feel safe?\" \n They do reach a certain level of intimacy which is very beautiful and poignant all at once. Both Jonah and Vivi are richly written characters, very damaged for sure. There is nothing superficial about anything in this book and I was also absolutely entranced by the detail with which the author described the various settings in the book. From Austin to New Orleans, there is a level and richness of detail here that is greatly appreciated by this reader. \n \"Jonah doesn\'t know me well enough to know that I\'m always ready to protect myself. My guard is always up. Still, I like that he always considers my safety even in the maddened heat of our mutual fever.\" \n I highlighted a zillion passages in this book and I can\'t possibly include them all here. Asking for It blew me away and is without a doubt one of my top reads of the year. Run, don\'t walk, to read this book. Don\'t let the blurb scare you away, there is so much more to this book and I need the next book NOW!!! Congratulations, Lilah Pace, on a magnificent story.'),

In this story, he is the virginal one and Bella is the one who enjoys sex and is not afraid to be the bold one. Hpw refreshing! The Shameless Hour is funny, sexy and heartbreaking all at once. Sarina takes some serious themes and incorporates them seamlessly into her story but gives her characters a fantastic HEA. \n Rafe is a hot soccer player who catches Bella\'s eye but who is inexperienced with women.

It was fresh, sexy, smart and funny and I was soooo excited when I heard Elle Kennedy was writing a story about John Logan! I have been immersed in college romances lately, and The Mistake is now another one of my favorites in this genre. \n Sure, not every college or college experience is like the setting of this story, but I adored the characters and their friends (well, excerpt for one) and their struggles to find themselves in what to me is also a great coming of age story. \n John Logan is absolutely Book Boyfriend material! Swoon!! I fell in love with him as he tried to win Grace over. Ms. Kennedy\'s writing style is sexy, fast-paced, heartwarming and very funny, and this book was like unwrapping a delicious treat. I loved reading about the characters\' backstories and loved the fabulous ending to this book. \n The Mistake was a flirty, steamy and fast read and I am now an even bigger fan of Elle Kennedy\'s writing. I loved this book and I think everyone at some point in their life has experienced some if not all of the emotions that these characters experienced. The Mistake is another winner from Elle Kennedy! \n Favorite quote (and I had many!!): \n \"We\'re the Lorris crime syndicate.\" \n I\'m dumbfounded. \n Oh my God. \n Lorris? As in Logan and Morris?

There are lots of reviewers who refuse to read this book, and that\'s fine. But based on its merits, I enjoyed this MM romance that comes with a healthy dose of sarcasm. \n Black Balled is a fairly quick read and is a parody of the indie book world, pairing a snarky book reviewer with tons of anxieties with an author who has tons of anger issues. The authors did a great job at the dual POV and really, when you peel away the layers of sarcasm and humor, the story is about finding yourself. \n \"Larson knows who he is and he makes no excuses or apologies for it. He wears his flaws just as proudly as he does his attributes, for all to see, and for everyone to accept or reject-as the case may be because it makes no difference to him. He is comfortable in his own skin. That is probably because Larson is genuine. He doesn\'t wear layers of facades that need to be ripped away in order to find his inner soul; or his truth. He just puts it all out there without reservation. \n Not like me.\" \n There is lots and lots of white-hot sex in this book and tons of great banter. If you go into Black Balled knowing it has a very different storyline, and that both characters have a wicked sense of humor, then you\'ll love this book!'),

He picks up and leaves Chicago and his meddling mother to start over again with a new job. \n I loved how the Gallo family is woven into this story. If you haven\'t read Chelle\'s Men of Ink series, you are missing out! They are filled with love, big families, snappy banter and lots and lots of mind-blowing sexy times. Get right on that! \n Sinful Intent is a fast-paced, steamy story involving Morgan\'s first job, investigating and protecting his first client, Race True, from harassing and threatening emails that have escalated. She is being blackmailed and he must find her tormenter. She is a buttoned-up, straight-laced corporate type, sexy but basically married to her job and she needs someone like Morgan in her life to add the spontaneity she has been sorely missing out on. \n Chelle\'s books are steamy, entertaining and have some of the most creative sex scenes I have ever read. Morgan is just, WOW. Race and Morgan together are just explosive. I liked the suspense and mystery along with the funny moments sprinkled throughout the book. I really enjoyed this book. It is overall a very enjoyable, sexy story and a great start to a new series by one of my favorite authors. \n Favorite Quotes: \n \"We all have scars. Some we can see and others we can\'t.

But Tom pushes Livvy away, she is very young and he cannot tell her why he is keeping her at a distance. \n \"I mean, I thought we had a... a friendship or something, and I don\'t understand what I\'ve done wrong.\" Addressing it made a weird emotional bubble grow in my chest, and my eyes started to sting. \n Livvy tries to begin a new life by finding a job at a local cafe and befriending the residents. But Tom battles his true feelings for her and settles on a friendship, as well as protecting her from the local bad boys. \n \"Lifting my arms tentatively, I slid them around his waist. I thought I felt him shudder. His muscles were bunched tight, or he was tense. I didn\'t know. He was hugging me. I could hug him back, right?\" \n This book tackles some highly sensitive subjects which are handled with great care and sensitivity by Ms. Boyd.

This book is the perfect cure for any kind of book slump you might be in. The characters are all richly written, the story is very different and creative, and the emotions this book inspires will have you wishing you there was more to this story. I did not want it to end! \n Sins of Sevin, told in alternating POV\'s, is about a fundamentally Christian household where the daughters must be courted before marriage by a man who has been chosen by the family. No kissing, no touching no NOTHING before marriage. The problem is, that Sevin is promised to a girl he does not love. His heart belongs to another. There are many factors at play here as to why he cannot be with the one he loves, his true soul mate, and these obstacles only make Sevin to be an even stronger, heartbreaking hero than is already is. \n \"You can\'t choose love. It chooses you, and once that happens, it doesn\'t let you go. You can pretend it\'s not there but when you try, it only fights harder...louder...until you finally get the message and give in.\" \n I do not read many other \"taboo\" romance books other than Penelope Ward. She is the Queen, bar none, of the forbidden romance genre. Sins of Sevin is another fantastic forbidden romance with a hero that I fell in love with from the first page. This book is filled with lots of anguish, emotion and plenty of guilt on the part of both main characters but the writing in this book flows so beautifully that even the most cynical reader with fall in love with Sevin (and MAYBE Evangeline!). \n Ms. Ward\'s story spans several years in time, which adds to the richness of the story.

Fences are mended and hearts are repaired along the way. But it is not an easy path, as Amelia has alienated most of her family and must hide her shattered heart in order to put things right again. We absolutely loved how the author really nailed what it\'s like to live with teenagers, and loved the scenes with Amelia\'s kids and Mickey\'s kids as well. \n Mickey has also had a rough past and resists falling for his gorgeous neighbor. He is a good man and might be one of our favorite KA heroes ever. Strong, sexy, low-key....yes, please!!

The sexy, sultry New Orleans setting; the smart, successful, handsome, yet damaged hero; the beautiful but skittish heroine, all of these add up to an unputdownable story.

One of the things I love about this author is that her heroes, no matter how tortured, always have the ability the love deeply and Saint is no exception. Despite his reputation, he really cares deeply for Rachel and their scenes together are perfect. \n I definitely recommend this series if you love a contemporary, witty, and passionate story with a great cast of supporting players.

I can\'t wait to see what\'s next for Rachel and Saint and am anxiously awaiting Ms. Manwhore! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(265, 30, 1, 5, '4.5 STARS!! \n \"Dragging my hand over my face, I pull my phone back out and try to focus on the man I need to beat. \n And I think of that nice girl who doesn\'t want to be nice. A girl who wants to be unforgettable and doesn\'t realize, she already is.\" \n MAVERICK!!!! I think I\'m in LOVE. Katy Evans has created a gorgeous, sensitive beast of a man. Another legend is born. \n Legend is the kind of Katy Evans book that I love, filled with passion, emotion, tons of sexy times and a deep emotional connection between the two main characters. This book goes back to the roots of the series, an lonely underdog fighting against the world, and a sweet, kind woman who is swept away by his passion. \n Maverick \"the Avenger\" Cage is an outcast in the underground fighting world. But he knows he can be the best if only someone would give him a chance and train with him. The best he can do is a down-and-out trainer named Oz. Reese is Remy\'s wife Brooke\'s cousin, and is traveling with them on the fighting circuit while taking care of their son, Racer. She is a loner, shy, and never thinks someone like Maverick would be interested in her. \n \"I wanted to be understood, and I wanted to be known. And I wanted to be loved.\" \n I LOVE a good underdog story and Legend fits the bill perfectly. There are no over-the-top characters here, just two people who are searching for something that they never had. And when Maverick and Reese get together, WOW!!!! Hello, new favorite book boyfriend!! \n \"Don\'t go after her if you don\'t think you can deserve her.\" He hits me again and I block, then jab him. He eases back and prowls around. So do I. \n \"Deserve her first. Then go after her.\" \n Reese and Maverick have a forbidden romance at first, because Maverick is in training to ultimately fight Remington \"Riptide\" Tate and challenge him for the championship. And nothing will stand in his way. But the truth comes out and Reese must decide whose corner she is really in. There\'s no question that Maverick is all hers, and he is the kind of man that knows when he has found the woman for him. I loved that Reese is not perfect, and the author makes sure to point out her insecurities. This is the kind of book that Katy Evans does best, filled with fierce warmth, hotness and a brute of a hero with a heart of gold. Maverick is EVERYTHING. I adored Legend and it is the perfect entry in the REAL series of books. \n Favorite quote: \n \"He doesn\'t say a word to me, but I can feel him. He\'s all I feel. Everywhere. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(266, 30, 22, 5, '4.5 sexy-Alpha stars!! \n Harper Sloan keeps getting better and better! I loved this book! The author has created more characters to fall in love with. Cohen and Dani are absolutely irresistible and their story was steamy, emotional, passionate and beautiful. This story has the perfect blend of sexy, heart-warming, funny and tension. I read this book in one sitting and really feel that it is one of Harper\'s best books. \n Dani is a sweet girl and knows from an early age that Cohen is her man. The problem is her overprotective Alpha father kept her almost locked away and she never thought that Cohen saw her as anything but the best friend\'s little sister. I loved that she really was honest with Cohen, she didn\'t try and hide her feelings. That was a refreshing twist for me. \n Cohen is another gorgeous, sexy Alpha as only Harper Sloan can create. He is brave, loving and will do anything to protect his girl. He never forgot Dani or gave up on them, even when he was in the middle of combat. \n \"Right in the middle of that Hell-on-earth chaos, I would hear her words trail through my thoughts right when I needed an extra push of strength or, God forbid, hope. I think that was the moment that I realized the enormity of it and that confession whispered all those years ago. Right or wrong, whatever it is between us would always be bigger than I understand. It\'s something that was so unexpected-- that feeling, craving, desire, to make her mine. It\'s something I\'ve almost felt guilty about over the years.\" \n Unexpected Fate is a thrilling, totally sexy story filled with family, love and emotion. I highly recommend it for all fans of Harper Sloan and for anyone who loves a fast-paced, steamy story. This story has a fabulous and satisfying ending and I can\'t wait for more books in this series! \n (ARC received from the the author in return for an honest review)'),
(267, 30, 71, 5, '4.5 - 5 Sexy - Sweet Stars!! \n Hello, Elle Kennedy! Thank you for this perfect blend of sexy, sweet and funny! The Deal is a palate cleanser, the kind of book that is a refreshing change of pace from dark, angsty, over-emotional stories. Even if you are not usually a fan of college romances, take a chance on The Deal, you won\'t be disappointed. Hannah is a smart, hard-working, self-sufficient music major, talented and unfortunately very closed off to any sort of interpersonal relationships. Garrett is a hockey player (Hello!! New favorite sport!), and a \"player\" in every other sense of the word. He is required to maintain a certain GPA to play on the team and for this, he needs a top-notch tutor for one of his classes. Enter Hannah. Excerpt that she absolutely refuses to have anything to do with Garrett. \n There is so much more to Garrett than meets the eye. I loved how he slowly breaks down Hannah\'s resistance and she discovers, to her total surprise, that he is actually an incredibly decent and yes, very irresistible guy. The Deal is a wonderfully layered story, with the characters getting to know one another and slowly developing a bond. There are no contrived situations here or over-the-top plot developments. The story is pure gold and I absolutely loved every single word of it! (There was only one \"oops\" moment in this story which hopefully won\'t reappear in The Mistake - American college students don\'t use \"meters\" to describe measurements - they would use feet.) \n There are also fabulous supporting characters here and I can\'t wait for their stories. Elle Kennedy has become a new favorite of mine and I look forward to reading more from her. Here are some of my favorite quotes from The Deal: \n I have to say, this is the first time a girl\'s been worried about getting caught in my bedroom. Normally they strut out like they\'ve just bagged Brad Pitt. \n Hannah takes a breath. \"We studied. We watched TV. I went home late. That\'s what happened. Got it?\" \n I fight back laughter. \"As you wish.\" \n \"Did you really just Princess Bride me?\" \n \"Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?\" \n She glowers. \n ************** \n I burst into the locker room and -- \n Penises! \n Sweet Jesus. \n Penises everywhere. \n Horror slams into me as I register what I\'m seeing. Oh God. I\'ve stumbled onto a penis convention. Big penises and small penises and fat penises and penis-shaped penises. It doesn\'t matter which direction I move my head because everywhere I look I see penises. \n (ARC provided with thanks for an honest review.)'),
(268, 31, 52, 5, '4.5 - 5 stars!! \n I absolutely loved this passionate and moody story and I need closure on Kes and Aimee\'s story, like, yesterday! I can\'t stop thinking about these characters. This is one of those very broody, very memorable stories that really gets under your skin. The first half of this book completely swept me away and immersed me into the small-town, Midwestern setting. Kestrel and Aimee had a simmering, sizzling attraction that grew from their close friendship as children. Kes, a bruised and battered soul, found something in Aimee that he could cling to and that would give him a glimmer of hope in his stolen youth. \n Kes was put to work in a traveling carnival at a young age, and while Aimee sees the carnival as a magical, almost mystical lifestyle, Kes sees the much harsher side of \"carnie\" life. His carnival returns to her small town each summer for 2 weeks, and their unlikely friendship blossoms over the years into a sexy, heated, full-blown relationship. \n \"Fate was against us. Screw that! Kes was moody and difficult, brilliant and beautiful. He scared me and protected me.\" \n Years pass, and finally Kes and Aimee might have the chance as adults to explore their searing and unbreakable bond. Kes has becom a star within the fair circuit, with women throwing themselves at him, as they did when he was younger. Aimee is a schoolteacher, living a safe and plain existence in a town in New England. What will happen when they are reunited? \n \"He was everything i wasn\'t, but somehow, together, there was a synergy, an alignment, something that just made sense.\" \n The first half of this book literlly blew me away! I could not put it down. The tone changed slightly in the second half but yet I am still 100% invested in this story and I cannot wait to see what the author has in store for these characters in the next book! Please note that this is book #1 in a series with somewhat of a sudden ending but I highly recommend it. Prepare to fall in love with Kes! \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(269, 32, 51, 5, 'There is nothing like the thrill of a new MC book from Joanna Wylde. Her characters feel real and each book is raw, sexy and fresh. Silver Bastard is no different, it is a thrill-ride from beginning to end. I fell in love with the two main characters and I absolutely adored Becca, she is a kick-ass heroine who is fighting for a better life and does so with humor and strength. \n We first met Puck in Reapers Stand and now it is five years later as Puck is out of prison after taking the fall for his MC. His first night of freedom and he meets Becca, in an awkward situation that turns ugly very fast. Puck is a stand-up guy and he basically saves Becca\'s life. Several years later, Becca is living in a small town in Northern Idaho, working and attending school. She is only 21 but is much older than her years. \n Becca knows that Puck is not the right guys for her, she has been trying to avoid trouble since she left home 5 years before. But the problem is that Puck can\'t stay away from Becca and feels protective of her in every sense. They fight, they argue, they battle, but this book is so filled with humor and fast-paced action that the classic \"will-they-won\'t they\" feels fresh and new and exciting. I couldn\'t put this book down! Silver Bastard is one of my favorite Joanna Wylde books and I have read them all. \n Puck can\'t stay away from Becca and he is an Alpha MC biker so... you can guess where things lead. Joanna Wylde\'s incredibly steamy scenes between Puck and Becca and the fantastic storyline kept me hooked from the very beginning. I can\'t say enough about her writing and her MC books. Although there are many serious and dark issues raised in this book, our hero and heroine eventually get their HEA (of course) and the funny and witty dialogue provided a welcome relief from all the drama. \n I love all Joanna Wylde\'s characters and I was excited to see some other characters introduced here. As usual, I can\'t wait for her next book. If you love great writing with tons of steamy scenes and some rough and gritty drama, then you will love Silver Bastard. \n Favorite Quote: (because this perfectly captured Puck and Becca): \n \"We\'ve been in a relationship for five years now,\" Puck said, his voice hard. \'It wasn\'t normal, it wasn\'t exclusive... Hell, I don\'t know what the fuck it was, but we both know that\'s the truth. Whatever\'s between us, it\'s been there since the first night we met.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

Mitch stayed in their area, even after his brother found a mate and even though he accepted that he would forever be alone. \n Frederick and Simon meet by chance and once again, Cardeno C.\'s incredibly loving, warm and sweet style took over to give these two the full life they had both been missing. \n Blue Mountain is a fairly short story, but is a wonderful, sweet addition to the author\'s work. Although Simon and Frederick are only really together towards the end of the story, the story and the characters really mesh perfectly together and I loved the direction the story took. I absolutely adored the narrator of this audiobook, even though I liked him best as the voice for Frederick and Mitch. I would like to hear Sean Crisden again as the narrator in future audiobooks. I highly recommend this story and the audio book for any reader of the m/m genre, even those new to the shapeshifter genre.

(271, 32, 89, 4, '4.5 Stars!! \n Swoon!!! Ladies and gentleman, meet Gray Grayson and prepare to fall in LOVE!! \n THE FRIEND ZONE is a super-funny, very steamy, and very romantic sports romance that I absolutely adored. It can be read as a standalone although two characters from The Hook-Up make appearances here. If you are looking for a fast-paced, clever story, then THE FRIEND ZONE is for you. \n I think one of my favorite quotes of the year so far has to be from this book: \n \"I\'m trying to commiserate, you noodle. Because the itching was torture when it grew back. And do not get me started on the pain of waxing. I was certain that evil woman had ripped my lady lips off.\" \n \"Lady lips? Oh Christ.\" His gleeful laughter echoes through the stadium. \n \"This is so not funny,\" I protest, my hands on my hips as his abs clench--which, unf--and he cracks up. \"It was the worst pain of my life. And I\'ve broken my arm in two places.\" \n Lady lips! I love it! But the story is great and the supporting characters all vital to the story and just as interesting as Gray and Ivy. Ivy has vowed never to do casual hook-ups, especially with an athlete. Her sports-agent father\'s lifestyle turned her off to that. And Gray isn\'t interested in a monogamous relationship, until of course, he meets Ivy. \n This book is extremely clever and the author creates a real and meaningful friendship between Ivy and Gray. Their relationship is believable, sweet and honest, and so their eventual sexy times did not feel rushed at all, but instead felt like a perfectly natural progression of their growing passion. \n And speaking of sex, did I mention that Gray is irresistible? Yep, perfect boyfriend material. The nighttime stadium scene? I died a little. He\'s an intelligent and incredibly gifted athlete with a bright future ahead if only he can withstand his sorry excuse for a family. \n \"To me it\'s a cathedral. I sit here and I feel calm, centered. And yet it\'s like all the energy of games past remains, coursing through my veins, and I can\'t wait for the next game.\" \n These two are meant for each other, it\'s just that they don\'t quite realize it at the beginning: \n \"His forearm tenses, and I find him staring at me with wide eyes. Pain resides there, and a sort of longing too. I recognize it in myself -- that need to have someone understand how empty life can feel, as if you\'re the only one in your universe. \n Gray holds my gaze for another second then clears his throat. \"Shit, Mac, you\'re going to have me bawling like a baby soon.\" He gives me a lopsided smile.\" \n Ivy and Gray care deeply for each other; they both had sad and lonely lives when they were younger, some of which has spilled over into their young adult lives and which has brought them closer together. But never fear, the author watches over your heart and doesn\'t let anything too painful happen to it. \n Gray falls for ivy, despite his surprise at the depth of his feelings for her. It was actually quite beautiful to watch his feelings unfold \n \"And that strange dichotomy is my Ivy. Insane planner mixed with a free spirit who goes with the flow. A surge of affection hits me, and I sink further into the pillows.\" \n Lest I forget to rave about the sexy times, they are HAWT!! Take one 6\'6\'\' football player who weighs well over 200 pounds, with a drop-dead body and a very sensitive and loving soul and you have the recipe for PERFECT sex! And they both like to act out fantasies. THUD. \n There are some very serious and sensitive moments in The Friend Zone, but they are handled with sensitivity and grace by the author. And the Epilogue was perfect! Not completely unexpected but tender and loving nonetheless.'),

(273, 32, 14, 4, 'Always You is a surprisingly good, second-chance romance that is modern, witty, steamy and filled with believable characters. This is a great debut from Stephanie Rose! I loved the story and absolutely loved the plot. This is an emotional story that grabbed me from the first page. \n Samantha is stuck in a loveless and heartless marriage and re-connects via Facebook with Lucas, her former college advisor. It is clear from the outset that Sam is with the wrong guy in more ways than one. Her husband Marc is an absentee husband and father. Lucas is wonderful to Sam and her daughter Bella, and Lucas and Bella\'s relationship makes up much of the heart of this story, it is just amazing. \n Lucas is, well, irresistible. He is smart, uber-sexy, respectful and H-O-T. Just what Sam needs. And when things with Marc take a nasty turn, Lucas is right there with Sam, supporting her emotionally, and ready to love Bella and Sam forever. Lucas is an amazing character and a perfect book boyfriend!! There are some really romantic scenes in Always You that touched me and melted my heart. As you can probably see, Sam was married when she first reconnects with Lucas but trust me, Marc is a horrible person who needed to be dealt with. Sam just didn\'t have to courage to act until Lucas came into the picture. \n There is lots of sexy time and sweet and sexy texting between our Hero and heroine. This book was surprisingly hot, very readable and enjoyable for all fans of steamy contemporary romance. The last scenes in the book were especially touching. I highly recommend this book for romance fans who like some steam to go along with their HEA. \n (ARC provided by the author with thanks.)'),
(274, 32, 93, 4, '4.5 Stars!! \n Silas and Charlie\'s epic journey continues! I\'m a huge fan of this series and Part 2 did not disappoint! Another fantastically thrilling and creative story from Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher. \n \"Never forget, Charlie. \n Never stop.\" \n NEVER NEVER PART TWO is another completely gripping and thrilling story that continues literally from where Part One left off. The characters continue to enthrall and the plot continues to thicken in the second installment of this very strange tale. Ms. Hoover and Ms. Fisher are two of my favorite authors so it is no surprise that I loved this book and read it in just one sitting. \n The feeling of disorientation continued in this story and I could not wait to see where Silas and Charlie\'s journey would go. Alas... more questions are raised and only a few answers are revealed. To me, this is not a paranormal story even though there are elements of what might be the supernatural here. I was very surprised by the turn of events here and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next story. \n We again have both POVs, which flowed perfectly and added to my enjoyment of the book. Leave it to these two authors to both grip my heartstrings with Silas and Charlie\'s story, and leave me feeling like I stepped off a roller-coaster ride, all at the same time. \n As you can see, these books are not standalones but if you like a twisty, thrilling, beautifully-written story, then don\'t miss Never Never. I absolutely adore this series and need the conclusion, like, NOW!!'),

There are very few books that I recommend to my daughter to read but this book is one of them. This story should be read by every woman, husband, boyfriend, son and brother because it contains one of the most powerful messages I have ever experienced. \n On the surface this book is the story of Lily, who has escaped to Boston from the small town she grew up in. Smart and driven, she opens her own shop and meets Ryle, a funny, handsome and brilliant surgeon. Revealing anything more about this book would do a tremendous disservice to the perfect way that Colleen Hoover has told this story. It builds slowly, bit by bit, to a painful and inevitable conclusion that took my breath away. \n As with all Colleen Hoover\'s books, IT ENDS WITH US is a stunner, magnificently written and absolutely unputdownable. My heart almost stopped in several places. It\'s that good!! Do yourself a favor and read this book - you will never forget it. \n \"Fifteen seconds.

Karina Halle hits another home run with this incredibly engaging and modern tale of dating, love and romance. This is a fun, fast-paced and very enjoyable read and a little bit of a different type of book for this author. And I loved every word. Linden and Stephanie are two incredibly engaging characters, both very endearing and sometimes maddening and in the end, just plain human, with all the insecurities, longings and sometimes-dysfunctional relationships that most of us deal with into our adulthood. \n These two are best friends, but also find each other irresistible. But they are terrified of ruing their close friendship by becoming involved romantically. So, they make a pact. At Linden\'s suggestion, they agree at age 25 that if they are not married by the age of 30, then they will marry each other. Sounds like a good idea, no? But the problem is that no one else can measure up to the other during all the years in between. At times, I just wanted to scream, \"Get together already!!\" \n \"I sip my drink and can\'t help but feel the slightest bit relieved. In five years, all the dating and the strife could be over. In five years, there\'s the tiniest possibility that I could marry my best friend.\" \n Linden is hot hot hot and the kind of guy that every girl swoons over. He can\'t seem to fully give himself to anyone and of course, is madly in love with Stephanie. She, however, is not quite sure if he was just kidding about the pact, but she, too, can\'t seem to find true love, either. \n \"I want to tell her all the filthy things I think about, be real, raw and unfiltered. I want to make her cheeks flush from my dirty mouth and her body with desire.\" \n Oh, yes, Linden is a dirty talker. Will they finally see through their stubborn resolve and give in to the feelings they have for each other? Things seem to come to a head during a camping weekend and they both seem to finally see the light. Finally! But will they be able to withstand all the outside forces and their own insecurities to be able to really make their incredible bond last? \n The Pact has one of the most romantic and heart-pounding endings I have ever read. I was alternately swooning and crying. Karina Halle has written a perfect contemporary romance - it has a believable and relatable hero and heroine, modern settings, real-life problems and lots and lots of incredibly steamy, off-the-charts sex!!

Struggling against dirt-poor poverty, absentee parents and an inevitable loss of his hearing, this book pulled at my heartstrings and thrilled me from beginning to end. \n Till is a fighter, taking care of his younger brothers to keep them out of the social services system. His only bright spot in an otherwise dismal existence is his neighbor Eliza Reynolds, who he spends every minute with after school, but who he completely ignores during the day. \n She is just a gorgeous person, inside and out, and Till is frightened of ruining their relationship with sex, so... they spend part of the book battling their attraction to each other. \n \"Eliza was a crier. She pretended that it was only when she was mad. That was bullshit though. She cried every time the wind blew north. Happy, sad, angry--it didn\'t matter. I loved it when she happy cried. I laughed when she angry cried. I was gutted when she sad cried. I\'d held her through all of them. But her reaction that night was extraordinary. I guessed my present was pretty extraordinary too though.\" \n Eliza is sensitive but strong. I loved that about her character! This is not a typical fighter story, it is fresh and new and make no mistake, Till and \"Doodle\" BURN up the pages when they get together. This story is told in alternating POV\'s and flashes forward in time but Aly Martinez does an amazing job with the alternating voices. \n This is a story of true devotion, fighting for happiness and fighting for the right to love and be loved. Sounds sappy, but this book is so much more! I loved it! \n \"Till and I both knew we had a strange relationship. It was more than a friendship, but there wasn\'t romance or sex. There was definitely love though. Immeasurable amounts of it. I knew that Till had this grand fantasy about me. But what he didn\'t realized was all that he gave me in return. He was the only thing I\'d ever had that I honestly thought I couldn\'t live without. Till Page was my soulmate on every level.\"'),
(278, 32, 71, 5, '4.5 stars!! \n This was my first book by Monica Murphy and it was brilliant! It exceeded all expectations and I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this series. \n Sexy, adult, erotic, this book has it all. Owning Violet introduces us to three sisters \"born to wealth, raised to succeed, ready to love, destined to make waves.\" As the daughters of the scion of a world-famous fragrance company (it brought Estee Lauder to mind), Violet and her sisters are all very different but all intimately entwined with the future of their family\'s company. \n Violet at first seems like a push-over and a doormat, her boyfriend almost openly cheats on her but she looks the other way, all in the name of the company. But I found her to be a compelling character, driven, eager to love and be loved, and above all, very ambitious. This book literally has it all: highly erotic sex scenes, an Alpha male and lots and lots of edge-of-your seat drama. \n Ryder is a sexy bad-boy co-worker who rose above his rough past to work in corporate America. Violet may appear to have it all, but she experienced a terrible trauma that is still haunting her to this day. While we might first see her as nothing more than a pawn in a rather sick game between Ryder and Pilar, a scheming woman who wants to bring her down, she is much, much more that that. Violet is no pawn and slowly begins to realize that the sexual relationship she has with Ryder might be much, much more and she must find her inner strength to beat Pilar at her own game. \n Owning Violet is an adult, erotic, steamy book and I loved the story and the amazingly intense scenes with her and Ryder. He is hot as hell, damaged, sexy, smart and ambitious. The steam factor was just genius. All in all, I loved this book and can\'t wait to read more from this author. I recommend this for anyone who loves a sexually-charged, fast-paced storyline with some very memorable characters. \n (*ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

Mia Asher is why I read contemporary romance. From the first page to the every last word, I was hooked, invested in the story and emotionally connected to the characters. If you have read the first book, EASY VIRTUE, then you know that Blaire is then between two men, Ronan and Lawrence. Who will win her heart? Will either of them? \n Tonight I let a man f* my brains out so he could eradicate a different man from my heart. I\'ve done it before but, this time, it didn\'t work. Ronan was everywhere. In every kiss and every touch. He still is. \n Ronan and Lawrence. Two irresistible men, both owning part of Blaire\'s heart, but in different ways. I can\'t decide which one I loved more, the author did an outstanding job creating two men who both stole my heart. Although Blaire and Lawrence\'s relationship was originally based on an arrangement for sex only, he became someone who Blaire could really fall in love with. But there\'s Ronan, always Ronan, on her mind and in her heart. \n Ronan has become embittered, jaded and filled with hate for Blaire. But the fantastic way in which the author tells the story here in multiple POV\'s had me racing through the story to see where it would end up. I did not want poor Ronan to be so bitter! He tries to erase Blaire from his mind but she is always there. \n When my lips touch hers , she closes her eyes and gives in to the kiss. I don\'t. I can\'t. And I f*king hate myself for it because even though I\'m kissing this woman, it\'s Blaire who I taste. \n I absolutely LOVED the conclusion to this story. It is rare for me to love a sequel as much as the first book but SWEETEST VENOM is pure gold. I applaud Mia Asher for the ending she gave to her characters here and dare I even hope that there could be more books with some of these characters?

This is NOT a pretty story - it is filled with lust and mayhem and violence - but it perfectly tells the story of Eva\'s parents, Preacher and Wheels (Debbie). \n This is one of my top favorite series EVER and I highly recommend reading the books in order. BUT you can read the first book right away to get a flavor for Madeline Sheehan\'s writing. \n Preacher lived an entire lifetime before we ever met Eva as a young child in \'Undeniable.\' His life was hard. But he was a survivor. \n \"Prison had been a painful wake-up call for Preacher. It had taken the man he\'d been, beaten the holy hell out of him, flushed him down the shitter, and sputtered and spit him back out a ravaged and shameful shell.\" \n Preacher met Debbie on the road. She, too, was a survivor and did what she had to do to get by on the streets. Madeline Sheehan took two very damaged and hardened souls and created something beautiful which is why I absolutely love her writing style. \n The book is told as a flashback as Preacher lays dying in the hospital. He is finally telling his story to his beloved daughter Eva. But everything I thought I knew about Preacher and Debbie was wrong! Preacher\'s tale is heartbreaking but I could not put this book down. I had to see it thought to the end. \n Preacher was in the biker life no matter what. Loyal and true to his family and biker brothers no matter what, he was a Demon through and through. \n \"According to the law and the state of New York, he was indeed a free man. But in reality, he wasn\'t free at all. He belonged to the Silver Demons body and soul, for better or worse. And if he stayed on this path, this wasn\'t going to be the last time he went to prison.\" \n Heart-wrenching and gritty, \'Undeserving\' is nonetheless an incredibly readable story. It must be experienced. Madeline Sheehan does not write hearts-and-flowers stories. But her biker romances are must-reads. While this wasn\'t as raw as \'Undeniable\', it is still one of the best examples of this genre. I can\'t wait for more books from Ms. Sheehan. She is one of my auto-buy authors. \n Favorite quote: \n \"I noticed you.\" Debbie\'s eyes darted back inside the cart, colliding with Preacher\'s. I noticed you. Those three words took flight, finding and nudging awake long hidden places inside of her.'),

When You\'re Back is the second book in Reese and Mase\'s story and other characters from my other favorite books all make appearances here. \n I loved River \"Captain\" Kipling! This guy is SEXY and broody. He is a bit mysterious and I am really looking forward to reading more about him! \n \"I can change your world, too, sweetheart. But I\'ll wait my turn.\" \n We also have Mase\'s cousin Aida here who gives the cold shoulder to sweet, loving Reese. I really liked how Reese blossomed in this book and how loving and devoted Mase is to her. He is one of my favorite of Abbi Glines\' characters and he is definitely book boyfriend material. Their scenes are touching, sexy and sweet, just what I expect from the Rosemary Beach series. I liked this book and recommend it if you are looking for a sexy, quick summertime read!'),
(283, 32, 10, 4, 'Crying!! From laughter. This book would make a great movie! \n Alice Clayton writes funny. sexy, adult romantic comedies. There\'s plenty of steam and always just the right amount of emotional tension to deliver a good, light, satisfying read. \n Mai Tai\'d Up is the story of Chloe and Lucas. This is a standalone and although Chloe was mentioned in Screwdrivered, you do not need to read the previous books! You can dive right in, and you will enjoy the story. \n Chloe is a \"runaway bride\" and realizes that she was not in love with her fiancee. Much to the horror of her very proper family, she picks up and moves away to begin a whole new chapter in her life. Her passion is reuse animals and she opens a rescue center for pit bulls. And that brings her to the handsome veterinarian in town, Lucas. \n The two begin a flirtation and and Chloe really begins to fall for Lucas. I mean, who wouldn\'t? A sexy vet? Hello! I loved their scenes together, and their relationship was a slow-build. There is one thing that Lucas can\'t stand, and when he finds out about Chloe\'s almost-trip to the altar, things blow up. \n I absolutely loved how independent and feisty Chloe was. She is no wallflower! She\'s smart and no pushover. Often heroines can be kind of a door mat but not Chloe. And there are plenty of really funny moments in this book to go along with the swoon-y romance. Overall I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a fresh, fun and breezy read. Alice Clayton really knows how to deliver a well-written, well-paced story. Oh, and this is a great book for dog lovers! \n Favorite quote: \n Here\'s the thing about an enormous penis. They don\'t just live in romance novels ... \n \"Pardon me?\" he finally said, his hands frozen on my hips, his lips halfway down my neck. \n \"Sorry. Actually, not sorry. Actually, congratulations.\" I pointed down. \"This is kind of amazing.\" \n He threw his head back and laughed out loud. \n (*ARC provided by the publisher with thanks.)'),
(284, 32, 30, 5, '6 STARS!!! \n Brilliant!! It took me a while to gather my thoughts on this story. I don\'t even know what to say about this book other than it was fan-freaking-tastic. Beth Flynn is a master storyteller. Let me stop right here and say that if you have not read Nine Minutes, you must must must read that book before starting this one. OUT OF TIME is filled with spoilers as well as a huge cast of characters that will have your head spinning if you have not yet read the first book. \n The events that occur in OOT are absolutely mind-boggling. Cathy and I both thought we knew where this story would go, but believe me, even in our wildest imaginations, we never could have guessed the twists and turns that occurred in this book. \n We are both huge Grizz fans. I loved him even more after reading the flashback scenes and learning about this childhood (such as it was.) His devotion/obsession with Ginny was more fully explained and the use of flashbacks was perfection. \n A word about that: Cathy is a tough reader, almost impossible to please, and she LOVED this book! She actually called it \"perfect\"! And that word sums up Beth Flynn\'s storytelling ability. Every character in Out of Time is essential, there are no throwaway scenes, and absolutely no unnecessary drama. Make no mistake, this book is violent, it is gritty but it is unbelievable gripping, intense and sexy. \n My heart broke several times over while reading this story. And while I am a GFFL (Grizz Fan for Life!), Beth Flynn did an amazing job with Grunt\'s character. His love for Ginny is endless. This is the kind of book that must be savored, re--read and discussed. There is that much going on. And the world of MC\'s is not in any way sugar-coated yet the story is immensely readable and unforgettable. \n At the core of this series is the love Grizz has for Ginny. It is unending. \n OUT OF TIME is without question one of the best books we have read this year. This series is a must-read. Don\'t miss out. \n \"The only truth you ever need to know is that my love for you is real and will never go away. And everything I\'ve done, no matter how it looks, is so you could be protected. I never wanted to be without you, but it\'s not my choice now.\"'),
(285, 32, 82, 5, 'Tiffany Reisz\'s writing is pure perfection. Her books are among my all-time favorites and The King was an absolute delight to read, from beginning to end. I have always loved Kingsley Edge so I couldn\'t wait to read an entire book about him! And once again, the author completely captivated and enthralled me. \n \"He thought of nothing, remembered nothing, but felt everything.\" \n This book mainly tells the story of Kingsley\'s relationship with Soren but there are plenty of other characters making an appearance in this book. Of course, I am addicted to Kingsley and Soren so their scenes together are completely mind-blowing and absolutely satisfying. This is a very adult and sophisticated book, the prose is gorgeous and the dialogue is pure genius. \n Even though I though I know Kingsley\'s story, the author provides plenty of delicious surprises along the way. I LOVED this book!!! It\'s sexy, funny, incredibly dramatic and gut-wrenching and completely amazing. I did miss Nora, she is not really the focus of The King but she plays a pivotal role nonetheless. The focus here is on Kingsley and his story. I adored the author\'s snappy banter, smart storyline and very topical themes. \n \"What\'s your poison?\" the bartender asked, and Kinglsey answered, \"Blonds.\" \n The King is a must-read!! You will lose yourself in this book. I miss Kingsley already! \n (*ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(286, 32, 70, 5, '4.5 stars!! \n Maybe Not is the funny, sexy and un-put-downable story of Warren and Bridgette and their sometimes rocky and always passionate road from enemies to lovers. This is a novella spin-off of MAYBE SOMEDAY and must, must, must be read after MAYBE SOMEDAY, which by the way is one of my all-time favorites and is not to be missed. There is a major spoiler in this story that will take away a bit from your enjoyment of Maybe Someday if you are a first-time reader. \n Once again, Colleen delivers a fresh, perfectly-written, intense and witty storyline that kept me reading well into the night. Warren can\'t stand his new roommate Bridgette at first, but their constant bickering, fighting and pranking quickly turns into something more: \n \"Oh, my God. I\'m obsessed. \n I\'m like a stalker. \n I am a stalker.\" \n \"She\'s so confusing, She\'s so frustrating. She\'s so damn unpredictable. \n She\'s nothing I\'ve ever wanted in a girl. And absolutely everything I need.\" \n I\'m kinda obsessed with Colleen\'s characters and Maybe Not is no excerption. The dialogue and the story are flawless and remind me once again why I will read anything this woman writes. Oh, and there\'s also plenty of steam in this one to please every romance reader.

(287, 33, 28, 4, '3.5 Stars!! \n Tessa and Luke. They absolutely can\'t stand each other...but really they are perfect for each other! All I Want is the second book in the Alabama Summer series and can be read as a standalone although it is recommended that you read Book #1 first. I have not read the first book and I still loved this second installment in the series. The sex is HOT, the attraction undeniable and the story fast-apced and gripping! Tessa and Luke are two incredibly stubborn people who just can\'t seem to stop torturing each other. Tessa broke up with Luke for what she thought was good reason (if a little misguided) and while he can\'t forgive her, he also can\'t seem to stay away from her, either. \n I\'m a sucker for a hot Alpha in a uniform and Luke is one protective, sexy cop. He has a very, very painful family life, one that he hides from Tessa, much to her dismay. Despite her initial resentment of Luke, and jealousy over his random hook-ups, she really wants to be there for him emotionally. \n Much of this book is spent with these two fighting and then having scorching hot sex. J. Daniels can really write a super-hot, sexy and fast-paced read that will keep you very entertained. This book is as lighthearted as some of her other books but it is very enjoyable and I recommend it for fans of second-chance romance and super-hot, sexy, Southern Alphas who won\'t take no for an answer! And not to fear, these two have a HEA, even after all of their emotional ups and downs. And I can\'t wait for the next book in this series, Reed! Bring it on!'),

This book has a little bit of a different tone to it than the previous books because there are lots of questions that are answered. This series is EPIC!! (And I would LOVE to see it made into a mini-series.) I\'m in denial that there is only one more book left in this series! I don\'t know how Ms. Winters dreams up these plots, but I\'m glad she has such an incredibly vivid imagination and I can\'t wait for the next book in the Weaver/Hawk family saga.'),
(289, 33, 2, 5, '5 DARK AND SEXY STARS!!! \n Pepper Winters has created yet another richly woven story in Final Debt, along with even more backstory and fantastic insight into the series\' characters. It is difficult for me to adequately describe my feelings about this book and the characters, first because I\'ve read early copies of almost every one of them and second because Jethro and Nila are two of my favorite main characters. It is hard to say the word \"hero\" in the same sentence as Jethro because of the dark nature of this series, but trust me, he truly becomes the man he is meant to be in Final Debt. And the Epilogue? Pure gold. \n I was completely and utterly satisfied with the way the author concluded this series. My emotions were all over the place while reading this last book and the Epilogue. At times I was fearful that the worst would happen, and at other times I was hoping against hope that Nila and Jethro would overcome all of the dark forces that conspired against them. To say this book is an emotional roller coaster is an understatement. The historical-romance-themed tone of this series again shines through in this book and I am THRILLED at the announcement of a related book about William Hawk! The only thing that would make me happier is if these books were made into a movie or television series. \n Expect LOTS of surprises in this incredibly satisfying conclusion to the Indebted Series. My heart is breaking a little at saying goodbye to Jethro and Nila.');

Affliction was a but of a surprise, having a much more emotional story than the first book in the series. This book can absolutely be read as a standalone, although the characters are first introduced in Book One and some of the plot might be a little spoiler-ish. \n Sy is angry, gruff, and hard-edged, having suffered a very, very painful loss several years before. He spends the first part of the book acting like a complete jerk towards our heroine Holly, and at times I almost felt like the author was making him into a lost cause. Holly is spirited and outgoing and we first meet her in Book One. She meets Sy when her best friend becomes involved with the Club President. \n Holly, too, has spiraled into a very dark place and Sy is drawn to her and knows that he can help her overcome her emotional scars. I grew to love Sy while reading this book and absolutely adored the protective way he treated Holly. While this story might seem like it is dark and very emotional, the sex scenes are off the charts hot and very, very steamy. And, there is actually a beautiful love story here and a lovely message about forgiveness, acceptance and letting go of the past. All in all, this is a great story for all fans of MC romance.

I didn\'t think I could love a couple any more than the other couples in this series but I was wrong. Oliver is sexy, sweet, romantic, and totally sensual and loving on top of it all!! No asshole-y-ness here, just a sexy-sweet, feel-good romance. \n I absolutely fell in love with Lola, she\'s a total geek and totally adorable. These two are the only ones of their group of friends who didn\'t stay married after the shenanigans in Las Vegas. But they are close friends who don\'t want to ruin a good thing by becoming involved romantically. Even though I knew what was ultimately in store for these two, it still didn\'t put a damper on my enjoyment of this lushly-written yet totally modern story. \n Oliver and Lola are two of the most \"real\" characters to date in this series. Lola is consumed with her work and Oliver backs off when she needs space. There is no unnecessary drama here, just two people who care deeply for each other, have smoking-hot chemistry but who have insecurities just like the rest of us. \n \"I don\'t think I\'ve ever loved anyone quite like this. In this sort of giddy, obliterating game-changing way.

Her dark and thrilling stories are among my most treasured books so I was absolutely thrilled to read a copy of Dirty Ties. I loved the crime/thriller/revenge twists in this story. As with all of Ms. Godwin\'s books, the characters are engaging, the story is twisted, and the steam factor is completely off the charts. \n Kaci is highly educated, hard working and a loyal wife to Collin. Their unconventional marriage has led to a lonely life for Kaci and she is desperately seeking the intimacy that is missing from with her husband. Her fascination with the underground racing circuit in Chicago leads her to the mysterious \"Evader\", a man who has plenty of secrets himself. These two become enmeshed in a dangerous game that will certainly leave one the of them broken. \n I love how Ms. Godwin always writes very strong heroines who aren\'t afraid to go after what they want. Her women are determined, smart and driven, and Kaci is no different. She might have met her match with a sexy man she meets one night, and these two together were absolute magic! \n \"She was a wild card, and that fucking terrified me.\" \n Lightening up this dark and sexy story are some humorous moments which were a welcome relief from the intense storyline. I especially loved Kaci and Collin\'s interactions and Kaci\'s internal debates, especially when it came to the hot new guy she meets: \n \"What about me?\" The possessive hand on my thigh clenched. \"Are you interested?\" \n Oh, let me count the ways.

This book is not a standard fighter romance, but instead takes its time developing the characters, their relationships and the secondary characters in this story. I loved it all! And I especially loved the British flavor to this book. \n While this book has PLENTY of steam and sexy times, Emily and Cormac\'s relationship is not just based on sex - they start off slowly as friends, because she is literally scared of her own shadow and frightened of a relationship with a man. Emily McCarthy is sweet, quite, smart and anti-social. It takes Cormac, to me a gentle giant, to slowly bring her out of her shell. \n \"Safe is boring.\" \n Emily is hard-working and paying her own way through University. She doesn\'t want to fall for Cormac but he takes things gradually, and vows to protect her no matter what. Eventually she learns to trust him and to let herself actually feel something for another person. \n \"He was the loud to my quiet, the confidence to my shyness, the rage to my pain. Separately, we were broken and alone. Together, we were blissfully happy and complete and every time that we made love was a celebration.\" \n There is plenty of tension in this fast-paced story and I adored the secondary characters as well.

Alex is an incredibly gifted hockey player who comes from an abusive background which is now affecting his game and his relationship with his teammates. \n As part of a penalty, he is required to volunteer at a local drug-abuse prevention program alongside the beautiful and selfless Sutton. She is different from the hockey groupies who throw themselves at him, but at first he is a total jerk to her. No matter. Sutton sees the wounded person inside and they begin to fall for each other, even as he tries to push her away emotionally. \n \"I\'ve been a prick far longer than I\'ve been charming. You\'re seeing a new side to me, but you know the old is bound to come out.\" \n \"We all have days when our monsters come out, Alex. You\'re not going to scare me off if I see yours.\" \n Sutton is feisty and educated and sees through Alex\'s B.S. She, too, comes from a dysfunctional family but unlike Alex, she has a positive outlook and is very close to her family. Will she be able to bring out the best in Alex and help him overcome his past demons? This book has more layers than a typical sports romance story and the characters really grew on me. I loved the hockey scenes and the steam factor between these two is AMAZING. \n I have one tiny issue with this story, and I have found that it is not just unique to this book. Why can\'t a heroine be on birth control because she doesn\'t want to get pregnant? Why does it have to be to regulate her periods? This did not affect my enjoyment of the book, I am just surprised to see this recur over and over again in books. Overall, I really like the author\'s writing style. Alex is a sweetly sexy story with a heroine who is no pushover. It is a quick, romantic read with a VERY satisfactory conclusion. I actually found myself tearing up near the end! I also LOVED the other team members and I know they will have some great stories, too. \n (*ARC provided in return for an honest review.)'),

Who they were didn\'t matter to me, I only cared that they were interested. That probably wasn\'t the best thing to admit, but it was the truth. Sex was a release for me. It made me feel like a part of something bigger than myself, made me feel connected to the world around me. And I needed to feel that way.

This story gives us insight into Kellan and Kiera\'s undeniable attraction, the heartache they both experienced and some amazing sexy times between the two of them. It is painful but compelling and I could not put this book down. \n \"For a brief second, I wondered what she really thought about me.

Like I was acting, and yet I was being more truthful than I ever was off the stage. I bled my heart out while I was performing, not that many people truly noticed; they were too busy enjoying the showmanship to dig beneath the surface of the words.

I totally connected with Gillian and Jake, and more importantly, FELT their connection, too. \n The chapter headings in this book are priceless and the story line was incredibly creative. Just when I thought the author was taking a predictable path, the plot veered off into unexpected territory. Our hero Jake is cold, distant and sarcastic, but boy can he fuck. He is a MACHINE. He has a woman waiting in every city. When our heroine Gillian meets him, they both agree to a strictly-sex arrangement. But of course you know that one of them is going to fall hard and get their heart broken. But it\'s what happens along the way that makes for a yummy, delicious, insanely addictive story. And oh my God, the sex in this book is burning hot. I mean this is totally NSFW, reading-under-the-covers kind of sex. \n \"We\'ll always be fucking, Gillian\" He smiled, biting my lip before tossing me onto the bed. \"That\'s the best part of us.\" \n This book would have been 5 stars for me except for some minor details.

Joker might be one Ms. Ashley\'s most unforgettable Alphas ever, a man who rose from a painful and loveless childhood to become a patched-in Brother of the Chaos MC. Chaos became his family, and the MC recognized the fire burning in Joker that would serve the club well. \n \"He was at the shop window, empty pockets, face pressed to the glass, starin\' at what he wanted but couldn\'t have. I\'ll wager, to survive, he\'s banked that fire. We gotta help him direct it and make sure if it flares bright, it doesn\'t burn him out.\" \n Carissa Teodoro\'s life becomes entwined with Joker\'s, as the two former high school classmates meet again years later. Let me just say that this book is so incredibly gripping and heartbreaking and sexy, that I am tempted to re-read it to experience these feelings all over again! She was once the golden girl who had it all, and he was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Their story spans years and that is what I love about Ms. Ashley\'s writing: there is no Insta-love here, instead, our hero and heroine have a shared history that adds a depth and richness to this book. \n \"Yeah, Carrie,\" he answered. \"It\'s you. It\'s always been you. It\'ll always be you. Fuckin\' always.\" \n Joker is a sexy, bad-ass Alpha biker that has zero interest in relationships, or in real friendships for that matter, since he has a hard time opening up to anyone about his feelings or his past. That is what makes his relationship with Carrie so poignant: this is a man who is so closed off and afraid of emotional bonds that he has been alone (and lonely) most of his life. \n Carrie draws his out just by being herself. She is going through a messy and painful divorce, has a baby, is struggling to make ends meet and has a ton of emotional baggage. She is not perfect but she is open to love and gives her heart unconditionally to Joker. \n \"Rule,\" he stated instantaneously. \n His strange word made me blink at the lockers. \"Sorry?\" \n \"Rule. You can\'t be like that on the phone. You can only be like that when I can kiss you.\" \n I lifted a hand and pressed it to the cold steel of my locker, leaning into it because my knees suddenly wouldn\'t support me. \n \"You hear me?\" he asked. \"Yes, Joker.\" \n OH. EM. GEE!! *SWOON* I can\'t say enough about Ride Steady. Plus some of my favorite bad-ass Alphas from Ms. Ashley\'s other books make appearances here! Dead. There is also a sneak peek at the next Chaos book at the end of Ride Steady and it sounds amazing. Joker and Carissa\'s story is beautiful, thrilling and passionate. Ride Steady is a must-read! \n Favorite quotes: \n \"Butterfly, you\'re cute all the time, cuter some times more than others, and it\'s fucked up because right now you\'re bein\' a pain in the ass and this is one of those times that you\'re cuter. But you gotta get this so you can get over it. My old man doesn\'t exist for me. I left him and that life behind, and I don\'t want it back in any way it can come back.\" \n \"We are who cares about us.\" \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(306, 34, 30, 4, 'Locke is the last book in the Corps Security Series. Although each book can be read as a standalone, the series is fantastic and you really get a sense of the strong camaraderie and history between the characters if you read the series. It is hard to say goodbye to these beloved characters but Harper Sloan does in in style with Locke. \n Locke has a horrible relationship with his family as does Emmy, each in a different way. They both suffer terrible emotional (and physical) abuse. Locke has been convinced by his family that he is worthless, evil, bad, etc., so it is no wonder that he believes he has nothing to offer anyone, let alone Emmy. \n Emmy has always loved Locke and when these two finally get together, it\'s the usual hot and fiery Corps-Security, bad-ass Alpha way! Locke won\'t let anyone or anything harm his Emmy and she helps him finally confront his own personal demons. \n This is a fast-paced, really sexy and hot read. I love this series and fell in love with all the Corps Security men. Locke\'s family felt a little over the top to me, almost cartoonish in their behavior but other than that, I loved this book and highly recommend it. \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(307, 34, 2, 5, 'Skye Warren is my go-to author for dark, sexy, richly-written erotica. Annika Martin is a new author to me and now I want to read all of her books, too! As with all of Skye\'s books, the hero Grayson (yes, he is a hero to me) is darkly sexy, dangerous, forbidden and completely overpowering. He knows his power and attraction and he uses it against those weaker than him. Unfortunately it is a survival skill he learned at a very young age. Abigail meets him in prison when she is picked to teach a writing course to the inmates. But very quickly she realizes that Grayson is dangerously attractive, untrustworthy and dishonest. Or is he? \n This book literally kept be turning the pages until the middle of the night. There is no right and wrong in this book, only two extremely damaged and vulnerable people who quickly become the target of a massive manhunt. Prisoner takes one thrilling turn after another, and Abigail, who fought Grayson with all her might, slowly realizes that all is not as it seems. \n I loved Abigail\'s bravery in the face of absolute and complete danger. At first it seems as though Grayson would just as soon kill her than f*** her. But as with all for Skye\'s books (and I will assume Annika\'s books as well), this intensely sexual man is struggling with his own inner demons. Grayson makes no apologies for his actions. But will he and Abby survive all of the forces out to destroy them. \n I couldn\'t put this book down. The prose is perfect and the story thrilling, sexy and even tender and heartbreaking at times. It is told in alternating point-of-views which gives great insight into Grayson\'s motivations. I was devastated to see this story end and I can only hope that the authors intend to write more stories including Grayson\'s crew. I absolutely loved Prisoner. It is gritty, raw, sexy, very layered and nuanced. Highly recommended.'),

And you go deep and leave your possessions and your ties to the world at the door and you like it inside and you don\'t want for your possessions or your ties and then, the book evaporates.\" \n Every word, every line of this book is PERFECT. I have never been so creeped out, or laughed so hard. I\'m obsessed with Joe Goldberg! \n Joe is obsessed with Beck. But I mean, hack into her email, stalk her every move kind of obsessed. And he is sick. Very, very sick. But that doesn\'t stop Caroline Kepnes from making him one of the funniest, creepiest, saddest, meanest and kindest characters of all time. He just wants Beck to love him. And that is no easy feat. Beck is at once smart, self-involved, funny, cruel and naive, but Joe is very, very determined. \n \"You are a woman and I am a man and we belong in the dark together and you smell good, pure. I like that.\" \n This is not a romance but it is without a doubt one of the most memorable books I have ever read. Just when you think Joe has sunk to a new low, he goes even lower. He is perverted and weird and I am obsessed with him!! This book is filled with absolutely unforgettable characters. And the jokes about New York City living are the best. As is the sarcastic, witty and biting commentary on modern life in general. \n I highlighted practically the entire book. I can\'t recommend YOU highly enough. It is a weird, wild ride.'),

I am a huge fan of Pepper Winters and RUIN & RULE is another dark, action-packed and twisted tale from this incredibly talented writer. \n If you\'re a fan of MC books, then you add this one to your must-read list!! It has it all, a strong, beautiful and spirited heroine, a tortured, complicated hero, tons of action and lots and lots of complicated plot twists and turns. \n PURE IN THOUGHTS AND VENGEANCE. CORRUPT IN ALL THINGS THAT MATTER, and the symbolism of what he stood for. Biker. \n I was on pins and needles from the first page of this book. I experienced the disorientation of our heroine, Sarah/Cleo, as she woke to the horrific reality of being held captive by a vicious MC gang. She feels a glimmer of recognition when she sees Arthur \"Kill\" Killian, but from where? When? I kept turning the pages to find the answers. Does Kill know her? Why is he so ruthless? There are so many to this story! Sarah/Cleo has lost her memory and her only clues to her past are tiny flashes of memories that come to her fleetingly. She feels a connection to Kill, but why? \n \"I\'m no one. And no one would\'ve helped me. In my world--you survive or you die. You don\'t rely on others to make sure you do either one. It\'s the very first fucking lesson you learn.\" The pain in his voice notched around my heart, squeezing. \n I loved the small glimpses from Kill\'s POV. This book is a fantastic bundle of delicious mysteries all wrapped up in a sexy, dangerous biker package. Despite his hardened demeanor, Kill slowly allows himself to feel something for our heroine, all the while knowing his feelings could be the end of him. \n For the first time in my godforsaken life, I felt... felt something instead of the cold hatred of vengeance. It gave me strength all while making me weak. I wanted more. Therefore, I had to stop. Before she destroyed me--just like all the rest. \n Pepper Winters made me feel sorry for Kill, despite his outwardly vicious demeanor. This was a man who had suffered terribly and been horribly mistreated. But by whom? Many answers are revealed but I am definitely craving more. \n \"I\'d been spoon-fed lies all my life. I\'d become a master at smelling untruths. And the woman currently residing in my home--the woman who\'d healed me -- smelled terrifyingly toxic. A scent that made me want to run with one heartbeat and then fuck her with the next. She made me face things I was no longer strong enough to face. She made me look past her scam and crave.\" \n RUIN & RULE is told through a series of flashbacks interwoven with the present-day story. Pepper Winters is the mistress of a gripping and intense story and this one is no exception. Just when I though I knew what the outcome would be, she proved me wrong. RUIN & RULE is also a STUNNINGLY beautiful love story and succeeds as a romance on every level. There is a twist at the end and I cannot wait to get the next chapter in Kill and Cleo\'s story!! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(311, 34, 3, 5, 'Debt is one of the darkest, most erotic books I have ever read. This story is not for the faint of heart so heed the warnings, but if you are ready for a stunning, thrilling, twisted and emotional story, then Debt is for you. \n A suspenseful and revenge-filled tale, Debt had me on the edge of my seat from the first page. I highlighted so much of this book that I could fill this review with amazing passages but read it for yourself and experience this fantastic and sexy story. I have never read a book by Nina Jones and she absolutely blew me away by this story. \n \"This man is my stalker, my terrorizer, my lover.\" \n Told in flashbacks and in alternating POV\'s, Debt is a story about Tax Draconi, who has come to settle an old debt from Mia Tibbett. He at first appears to be filled with hate, revenge and basically, with pure evil. His actions throughout much of the book are absolutely unforgivable. But the author is an absolute genius at making me actually love Tax and empathize with him. The scenes with Mia are beyond explicit. Tax brings new meaning to the phrase \"dirty talker\". \n \"It\'s what I do when it comes to women. I can\'t give them affection, or love, or intimacy. That all died in me long ago. So I give what I can: Relief. Pleasure. Abandon.\" \n The focus of his plan is Mia, who remains mostly clueless about why Tax hates her so much, but still finds herself powerless under his erotic spell. He owns her, body and soul. She realizes that he has ruined her for other men and despite his evil ways, she still feels compelled to try to break through his wicked exterior. \n \"Is it possible Tax could be everything I need in a man? He has the fire that burns me and awakens me. That was the thing I had been looking for, and it is so uniquely hard to find.\" \n The trauma that Tax and his twin sister Jude suffered at a young age is hinted at throughout the story and when finally revealed, sheds light on his behavior and Jude\'s thirst for revenge against Mia as well. This book might shock you but the story flows and the characters are unforgettable. I found a few minor inconsistencies with the story which in no way took away from my enjoyment of this dark, sexy. erotic, dark and fantastic story. I was distraught that Debt ended and I am waiting not-so-patiently for more from Ms. Nina G. Jones! \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(312, 35, 38, 5, '5 perfect stars!!! \n Well. Where do I begin? Bad Romeo is one of my favorite books of the year. It is the perfect blend of coming-of-age, intense longing, heartache, friendship and first love. The story is told in a mix of present-day and flashbacks which can be confusing but work perfectly here. Ethan Holt is the classic bad-boy, who smashed Cassie Taylor\'s heart when they were drama students. Flash-forward to present day, when they are both cast as the leads in a Broadway play. Told from Cassie\'s point of view, the book follows their completely tortured, angst-filled relationship. But don\'t be scared away: this book is raunchy, laugh-out-loud funny and will keep you turning the pages to see what will happen next. \n Can Cassie work with Ethan again after what he did to her in the past? She can\'t seem to stay away from him and Leisa Rayven gives a wonderful, slow-build story that kept me reading until the wee hours of the night. I was fascinated by the behind-the-scenes look at the theatre world and the sometimes-painful description of the acting process. And even though this is a New Adult novel, it is incredibly sexy and steamy and filled with just the right blend of longing and sexual release. And Cassie, what a fantastic heroine! She\'s smart, tough-on-the-outside but very vulnerable, and funny as hell. I fell in love with Ethan Holt and even though he was portrayed as a jerk, felt sympathetic towards him because of his tortured past. I can\'t say enough about this book!! \n After I finished this book, I was fascinated to read that it originally began as fan fiction. How did I not know this? I am now officially addicted to this series and this author. I highlighted practically the entire book. The ending was perfection and I am literally counting the days until the next book, Broken Juliet!! \n (*ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

I was completely unprepared to fall in love with Zach but I did and I miss him already. There are some books that merely recite one sex scene after another, with no emotional connection between the characters and writing that fails to connect the reader with the characters. Well, not Uncivilized. Ms. Bennett has written a sensitive, interesting, very different story with absolutely memorable characters that will stay with me for a long time. \n Zach at first comes across as a somewhat cold, savage man who will never become acclimated to the modern world. But is that such a bad thing? As the story progresses, Moira becomes more willing to bend towards Zach\'s way of life and his belief system. And this man is HOT HOT HOT. The book\'s sex scenes are absolutely among the most gorgeous, lush and loving scenes I have ever read. \n This book could have been a cliche but it\'s most definitely not. I loved the world created by Ms. Bennett and I highly recommend Uncivilized. Enjoy! And have a freezer nearby! \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for a honest review.)'),
(314, 35, 86, 4, '3 1/2 stars!! \n Dark. Dark. Dark. Those were my first thoughts upon finishing Raze. I love a good dark and gritty romance and Raze fits the bill. This book is filled with intense drama and brutal scenes of torture so be warned. I have a very strong threshold for dark reads, but there was an extra element that didn\'t quite sit well with me. That being said, this book has an incredibly creative storyline and some hot, steamy, passionate and over-the-top sex scenes that are alone worth reading the book for. \n This story is told in flashbacks. Raze was brutally ripped from his home as a teenager and subjected to all kinds of physical and mental abuse at the hands of an underground fighting ring. He loses his memories of his family and his childhood and literally turns into a fighting machine, bent on revenge against the monster who put him away. These scenes in the underground are difficult, tough and gritty. \n Raze has the vaguest memories of a girl who is Kisa, the daughter of a New York Russsian mobster. She, too, is condemned to a live of confinement as the fiancee of Alik, a sadisitic, brutal and controlling fighter. The stage is set for her past and her present to collide. Will she able to save Raze from almost-certain death? Will Raze ever remember Kisa, the only girl he ever loved? \n \"I\'ve seen too many bad things with these eyes. This, I will feel in my heart.\" \n There are scenes of incredible beauty in this book along with scenes so brutal they are difficult to get through. But all in all, this story kept me turning the pages to see where these characters\' journeys would take them. I was cheering for Kisa to stand up to Alik and rooting for Raze to be able to find the peace he so desperately needed. If you like gritty fighter stories, then Raze is the book for you!'),

The writing is so perfect, the story is so creative and the characters are so vivid that I felt like a piece of me was missing was I finished this book. I felt like I knew Ben and Fallon personally, that\'s how expressive Colleen Hoover\'s writing is. \n Fallon is damaged goods, growing up in Hollywood and having survived both emotional and physical trauma when she and Ben meet. \n \"One of the things I always try to remind myself is that everyone has scars,\" she says. \"A lot of them even worse than mine. The only difference is that mine are visible and most people\'s aren\'t.\" \n Fallon and Ben are only teenagers when they first meet, literally on the eve of her big move to New York City. Could what Fallon feels for Ben be real and lasting? Only time will tell, as they make a pact to meet only once a year until she turns 23. No contact, no social media stalking, nothing, until their annual \"dates\". Fallon believes that this is the only way for her to be mature enough and self-reliant enough to be in a relationship with Ben. She is determined not to lose herself in a man. \n But oh so much can happen in the time in between, and as the story unfolds from the past to the present, I began to realize what this book was really about. My heart broke for both Fallon and for Ben, and I was completely taken aback by the path this story took. \n There are SO many memorable moments in this book, and they all took my breath away. Imagine think you have met your soul mate, only to see them once a year for the next few years! I wanted to scream at Fallon and Ben to grab onto their love and never let it go. \n \"Please say yes.

His epic work Special Forces is one of my favorite books. Please heed the author warnings about Guns N\' Boys, this is a dirrrrrrrty, homoerotic, violent crime thriller. But wow, what a ride! This book grabbed me from the first page an did not let go. \n Seth is the son of a crime lord and is rescued and secreted home by the irresistibly sexy, dangerous and dominant Domenico. The two were childhood friends but hadn\'t seen or spoken to each other in years. \n \"Domenico was the human equivalent of his motorbike. Fast and dangerous, yet impossible to resist taking a ride on, even at the risk of getting hurt.\" \n This book is a fast-paced, super-sexy, graphic and very intense story of two men in a forbidden relationship. Seth and Dom could not be more different, but yet find themselves drawn to each other. They must hide their relationship, and the underlying tension between these two had me on the edge of my seat. \n There is a fantastic surprise for fans of the Dark Souls series!! Even if you haven\'t read the series, you will love the character of Sylvio. Guns N\' Boys is a super-hot, incredibly well-written, steamy thriller.

Great book for dark romance fans. \n Told in dual POV\'s, Ricochet pulled me in from the first page and was one of those books that I could not put down. The storyline is very fresh, very original and very, very violent and dark. Which I totally loved. \n Nick is hell-bent on the revenge of his family\'s violent death and Aubree is a pawn in his scheme. But she is trapped in a hellish world of her own, in a marriage to a sadistic, powerful man from whom she is all to relieved to escape. \n Even before Nick abducts her, Aubree is fascinated with a mysterious masked man who warns Detroit\'s ruling elite that the city\'s criminal element is coming down: \n \"I\'d become obsessed with him just the same. Behind that mask was a mastermind of the most notorious computer hacks the city had ever known. His bold threats, his willingness to take on my psychopathic husband, had turned him into my own personal fantasy. \n Is Nick the same, myserious dark avenger? Ricochet is not your average dark-romance kidnap story. Nick is cruel to Aubree but she slowly becomes obsessed with him, and he with her. Even though she started out as just a faceless pawn in his game. \n \"I\'d fallen in lust with a complete stranger, strictly on the basis that he happened to scare the shit out of my husband. \n Aubree sees the hurt and pain behind Nick\'s rage and he slowly realizes that Aubree has suffered as well: \n \"I saw darkness in her beauty, and she saw beauty in my darkness. Yin and yang. Black and white. Beauty and scars; fury and forgiveness. She should\'ve been my nemesis, but in her, I found something I didn\'t know I was looking for.\" \n The law of the streets rule in this book and the action is gritty and unrelenting.

We both loved this book and found it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story filled with amazing and memorable characters. And Gus, hello!! What an amazing guy!! Perfect. He\'s loyal, sexy, honest, hard-working and always there for Kate. \n This book tackles some very sensitive subjects so this will be a completely spoiler-free review. Kate is very funny, tough on the outside, and gives a lesson in what\'s important in life to just about everyone she meets. Cathy is not a huge fan of mature young adult novels and even she loved this one! \n \"Katie didn\'t just look on the bright side, she lived there.\" \n And let\'s not forget Keller. We loved Kate with Keller! Once their slow-build relationship picked up steam, they were irresistible together. The alternating POV\'s told in the form of diary entries worked great in this book and really gave great insight into each of the character\'s state of mind. Keller grew emotionally and matured over the course of the story which was a beautiful thing to see. \n \"Just when you think you know someone, they change. Or you change. Or maybe you both change. And that changes everything.\" \n I loved the book and would have really adored more steamy scenes between Keller and Kate. Cathy would have liked a little deeper exploration into the music scene.

She is back with another super-sexy, witty and warm-hearted story that made me laugh at loud and tear up a bit. \n Brent and Kennedy\'s story is sexy, funny, and completely endearing. Brent won me over and once again, Ms. Chase shows her skills at writing the male POV. \n Brent Mason is a top lawyer and is totally surprised to see Kennedy Randolph again after many years. She was a sweet and nerdy girl who has now blossomed into a beautiful swan, who is also gorgeous, smart and his adversary in the courtroom. \n Irresistible Brent sleeps around (a LOT) but never forgot his first love. Kennedy and Brent now face off in court in a high-profile case which added lots of opportunities for these two to really let the sparks fly. But it\'s the supporting cast of characters as well as the witty banter between these two that are central to this story. An interesting twist to the story is that Brent lost his leg in a childhood accident. He doesn\'t let this slow him down in ANY area of his life. This was a refreshing change of pace in an otherwise funny and sexy contemporary romance story. \n Kennedy is scared of getting involved with Brent after all these years and the flashbacks to her teenage years, when she was bullied at school, are very poignant and form a stark contrast to the smart, successful attorney she is now. But Brent will stop at nothing to show Kennedy that she is the love of his life, and he is one determined guy! \n \"...I collapse on top of her, my bones turned to Jell-o. \n When the aftershocks eventually ebb, she laughs.

Mia Sheridan has become one of my go-to favorite authors for creative story lines, heart-stopping emotion, and beautiful, glorious, sexy and REAL love scenes. \n This will be a short review because both books should be read together and contain so many twists and turns, they are best read without knowing too much detail. Just know that the author answers all questions left open at the end of Becoming Calder, and delivers an incredibly satisfying conclusion for these two amazing characters. \n Calder and Eden take an incredible journey and Ms. Sheridan lets you experience every heart-stopping second of it. Both books taken together are about staying strong, staying true to yourself even when everyone around you tells you something different, and overcoming incredible obstacles to find your one true love. \n This isn\'t all hearts and flowers; there are some really steamy sex scenes along with some very brutal scenes of psychological and physical abuse. But the author really knows how to bring an epic love story to a wonderful conclusion and Finding Eden does all of that and more. \n \"And we\'ll spend as much time as we need just escaping from the world. That\'s our plan because I swear to you, my beautiful, sweet love, everyone deserves a love story that doesn\'t hurt.\" \n In the end, Finding Eden is a story about forgiveness and learning to love yourself no matter what has happened to you in the past. Run, don\'t walk, to pick up a copy of both Becoming Calder and Finding Eden. Your life will be all the better for having read these books. \n Favorite Quote (well, one of many!): \n \"We have to figure out how to forgive, not for the people who wronged us, but for us. We can\'t keep bitterness attached to our hearts because eventually, it might become part of us--so deeply ingrained we can\'t work it back out.

Jason is a broody, folksy musician whereas Brooklyn is a \"pop princess\". But she actually writes all of her own songs and is really a very warm, smart, funny, sarcastic woman who is lonely and wants to really experience love, not just write about it. Jason only sees the stereotype and is very judgmental toward her at first. \n The Duet is very funny, witty, sexy and just plain un-put-downable.

The banter between Jason and Brooklyn is absolutely priceless and the story never sinks into sentimentality but instead stays fresh, modern and very, very witty. \n Jason and Brooklyn begin a no-strings-attached sexual relationship which of course turns into much more for Brooklyn. I absolutely loved the sexy times between these two and I loved watching Jason\'s douche-y, \"asshole-ian\" (no, not a word!) facade slowly change. But he is hiding a whopper of a secret and I was sitting on the edge of my seat to see how this would play out. \n The Duet is for sure a romantic comedy but it is much more. It is about accepting who you are, being true to yourself, always being honest and the importance of keeping your heart open to love. I love R.S. Grey and am totally excited to see that Brooklyn\'s sister Cammie, a brilliant architecture student, will be getting her own story with Grayson, one of Brooklyn\'s best friends! Bring it on!!'),
(325, 37, 53, 4, 'Great conclusion to Andrew and Aubrey\'s story in this surprisingly well-written installment. The emotions in the third installment of RD were deeper and the story was more detailed than the first two books in this series. I loved the characters. If you can suspend disbelief about working in a law firm, then you will love this series. Much of the legal part of the story was accurate enough, which was very refreshing. This series is a great, fairly fast read, filled with characters you love and characters you love to hate. Looking forward to much more from Whitney G.!!'),

Cosway is such a talented writer that you should give Painted Faces a try, too. Nicholas is such a memorable and haunting character that I will always remember him. Beautiful, sexy, sensitive, angry and loving -- he is all these things and more. \n \"I like to think of myself as a wonderful and unique snowflake.\" \n Killer Queen is basically Nicholas\' POV along with some additional scenes. You really gain a lot of insight into Nicholas\' character in this book and the Epilogue is absolutely fantastic. This is a very, very unique story - definitely not your standard contemporary romance - and it will change the way you look at gender and sexuality and men and women. I also loved the added touch of song lyrics at the beginning of each chapter to really match the tone of the story. \n I love L.H. Cosway\'s writing and have every one of her books on my Kindle. Can\'t wait to read more by this incredibly gifted author. \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero, which I loved, the plot of this book fell flat for me and the so-called scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all. Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself. I adore Kate McCarthy (Redemption is one of my top favorites) and look forward to her next book!'),

I should\'ve known it wouldn\'t last.\" \n We are HUGE fans of Joanna Wylde\'s Reapers\' Motorcycle Club series and Reaper\'s Stand might be our favorite book in the series so far! And that\'s saying a lot because each of these books are fantastic. But Picnic\'s story is grittier, edgier, meaner...and hello, we love that he is a bit older and has certainly lived a rough life. He has sex with loads of women since the death of his beloved wife, won\'t be tied down, but then meets London, who is a strong, independent woman. She has lots of burdens to bear and tries to make a go of things with out Picnic\'s help, but when these two get together...WOW. He\'s bad-ass, tough, sexy but funny and this story is one you just can\'t put down. \n \"Just let me be strong for you for a minute, okay?\" He said softly. \"You\'ve held on for a long time, sweetheart. Nobody can say you haven\'t been strong. But it\'s been a hell of a night, so why don\'t you let me hold you and help you right now, okay?\" \n We found this book to be incredibly hot and sexy and much darker than most of the other books in this series. We absolutely loved these two together and Reaper\'s Stand is one of our favorite MC stories. It is violent but it is also real and the funny moments add some much-needed levity to the tense storyline. And the tease at the end...oh my lord!! The author gives us a peek at the next book in a new series and we cannot WAIT!! \n *ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review*'),

(330, 37, 93, 5, 'Stepbrother Dearest is, to put it simply, one of my favorite books this year. I am trying to avoid using the word epic here as it has been overused a bit, but this story took me on an incredible journey that left me nothing short of anxious, elated, enchanted and drained. Penelope Ward is hands down one of my favorite authors and this book is an absolute must read. \n The story follows Greta and Elec who are step-siblings. But like all of Ms. Ward\'s books, there are many layers and nuances to this book and nothing is quite as it seems. \n \"I won\'t give you exactly the same thing...but I can give you more. Okay? I can give you better. It may be one night, but I will make every second count.\" \n Although Elec is her stepbrother, I really didn\'t feel that Greta\'s love for him was forbidden. You will have to read the book and judge for yourself on that one. What I did feel was the incredible sexual tension, emotion, surprise, and yes, even humor in Ms. Ward\'s writing. \n \"Nowadays, every single guy seemed to pale in comparison to Elec on the physical attraction meter. I wanted to crush that meter with a sledgehammer.\" \n Greta is smart, quirky, funny and compassionate. Elec is angry, cocky, sexy and irresistible. Slowly but surely, Greta begins to see behind his angry facade and they eventually form a deep bond. \n \"... I thought about how ironic it was that this guy who\'d done nothing but try to chase me away and intimidate me was the one person in the world I felt like I wanted to protect.\" \n But this is only in the first part of the book! In true Penelope Ward style, STEPBROTHER DEAREST is a richly woven tale that spans many years. The characters grow, move on, and the story almost loops back on itself. No spoilers here, just read this sexy, funny, emotional and fascinating story for yourself. And be prepared to have your heart stolen by Elec. \n (*ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(331, 37, 96, 5, '4.5 scorching hot stars!! \n This was my first book by Nalini Singh and it is a passionate, emotional, sexy and fulfilling story. I loved this book! The writing is incredibly sexy, beginning right from almost the first page when sexy-as-hell rock god Fox meets the shy librarian Molly at a party. It might sound cliched but the story is so well written, and the characters so well-developed, that I was drawn in immediately. \n Molly has her reasons for staying out of the spotlight so a good part of the book is spent with her anquishing over stepping into the public arena with a world-famous musician. But she is powerless to resist Fox, a man who knows what he wants and goes after it. This book is fast-paced and takes the reader around the globe to New Zealand, Australia and California. And the supporting characters are fantastic, from Molly\'s best friend Charlotte to all of the other band members. Can\'t wait to read more about all these characters. \n This was a wonderful story and the sex is incredibly HOT!! The book also created the oh-so-important emotional connection between the main characters. I also absolutely fell in love with Fox! This story is a must-read and is a great begninning to a new series. Highly recommended to all fans of contemporary romance.'),
(332, 37, 20, 5, 'WHOA!! What a ride! Fantastic story. To say it is unexpected is an understatement. Stayed up all night to finish. READ THIS BOOK! \n These were my first thoughts upon finishing this book, an ARC of which was graciously provided by the author. Why was I on her ARC list? No clue. But I thank her from the bottom of my heart. This is an original story, with well-written, fully-developed characters, and clever twists and turns which forged a connection between the book and myself. Am I gushing? Yes. Because there are SO many books today that have cookie-cutter plots with cliche characters, I find it incredibly refreshing to come across a story like Black Lies. \n There is no plot or character discussion here. Read the synopsis. That\'s all you need. Was this a 100% perfect story? No. But it is absolutely one of the best books I have read this year and I applaud Ms. Torre for her story. \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Come take a wild ride through the author\'s City of Angels, and enjoy every second of the hot and thrilling rollercoaster ride. Antonio and Theresa got under my skin and I can\'t wait for even more of their story. \n Ruin begins shortly after Spin ended. Theresa has become incredibly determined and strong and will do anything, ANYTHING, to protect and stay with Antonio. But he is lethal, dangerous and also determined to keep Theresa out of harm\'s way. Not an easy feat when the mafia is out ot get you and no one is to be trusted. \n Theresa is still close to her family and Antonio \"Spin\" is acutely aware of that. But he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe, even when the things quite literally start to spin out of control. He tries to keep her isolated but she will have none of that and his carefully-crafted plans begin to quickly unravel and escalate to an incredibly satisfying conclusion. \n This is an action-packed, super-hot and sexy story. The writing is gorgeous and spare. There are no flowery words, no gushing declarations in the world of Antonio Spinelli. But surprisingly, there is humor, which provides a welcome relief from the near-constant state of tension and almost primal sexual urges. Spin loves Theresa in his own way, and they are both completely obsessed with each other and cannot stay apart. \n \"You\'re from a different world , but you smell like home to me. I haven\'t been to Napoli in ten years, but whenever you\'re near me, I smell olive flowers. My heart gets sick with thirst, and the water is poison.\" \n I can\'t stop thinking about Spin and Theresa. C.D. Reiss has become one of my favorite writers and I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment in this series. \n (*ARC reviewed from NetGalley.)'),
(334, 37, 48, 5, 'LOVED IT!!! Refreshingly funny, sweet and sexy! \n The Stage Dive series is one of my favorite series and Lead is an absolute delight. Sexy, refreshingly funny and smart, Lead not only features the achingly beautiful Jimmy, it also introduces us to the fabulous Lena, who in my opinion could be every woman\'s new best friend. Honest, funny and real, Kylie Scott has written a completely relatable heroine who at times broke my heart and other times had me laughing at loud. \n Lena knew that Jimmy would be her Achilles heel almost from the get-go when she is hired to be his assistant and sobriety companion. \n \"Whatever else he might be, Jimmy Ferris was special and complicated, beautiful and beastly, all rolled into one. A natural-born performer.\" \n Lena struggles to fit in to the rest of the band dynamics and all the sexy couples of the Stage Dive family. She is tenacious, hilarious and completely turned on and attracted to Jimmy, but the real Jimmy, not the rock-star persona. \n \"My heroin was six-foot-one and gorgeous as sin.\" \n Lena has had her share of heartache, and is afraid that Jimmy will steal her heart away while she is working as his assistant and stomp on it in the process. I absolutely loved how strong Lena was and how she really stayed true to herself and did not try to hide her true feelings for Jimmy. Will these two get their happy ending that they so desperately deserve? \n \"Love was truly one of life\'s mysteries. That it could f@@@ you five ways to Sunday and still remain so utterly perplexing and unknown was kind of impressive.

(335, 37, 48, 4, 'I LOVED this funny, sexy romance from Amber L. Johnson! The story is fresh and creative and I absolutely fell in love with Andrew. What starts off as cute storyline turns into a lovely, sweet and very, very funny story about overworked Gwen, who is struggling to manage raising two young children on her own, and Andrew, a wealthy, seemingly carefree guy, who must get a job and really wants to become responsible and self-sufficient and please his cold and distant father. \n Eight Days a Week is a fantastic \"lighter\" read, with an unexpected storyline and interesting characters. My heart ached for Andrew; he has spent his life trying to please his parents and live up to his \"perfect\" older sister. He sees his chance at redemption when he becomes \"manny\" for Gwen\'s young family and actually finds something he is very good at. The children love him and of course, he is madly attracted to Gwen. But they both decide not to pursue their insane chemistry for the sake of the children, because what would happen if they broke up? \n Will these two be able to love each other and keep their new family together? I adore Amber Johnson\'s writing style and was laughing out loud as well as totally swooning many times during this book. The sexy times are HOT and Andrew really has it all: looks, brains and talent. What woman wouldn\'t fall for him? I loved this book and highly recommend it for all fans of sexy, funny contemporary romance.'),
(336, 37, 61, 4, 'First, I was very pleasantly suprised at the steam factor in this book! And Thomas Maddox is a memorable character, that\'s for sure. \n I really liked the romantic suspense aspect of this story, and I really admire the author for writing a strong female character. Oh look, it\'s okay to be a workaholic and be a professional! I am on board with female characters who are not just window-dressing or who do nothing but sorrt of flit around the story. But I digress. \n Liis and Thomas do connect early on, but it really works in this book. Jamie can really write a steamy hot sex scene and I can\'t wait to read more of this from her!Liis is smart but she is pretty insecure in her personal life. \n I\'d gone from feeling sexy and desired to an embarassingly eager, cheap score. \n Liis and Thomas must later work together as FBI agents and this aspect of the story was very fast-paced and interesting. Liis, like Thomas, is devoted to her work which has not left much time for a personal life. \n \"Ah. You\'re married to the job. Betty Bureau.\" \n Thomas is a total hard-ass and has a notorious reputation for being impossible to work for. Will he soften for Liis? I loved seeing the other Maddox brothers make an appearance here, but make no mistake, this was Thomas\' story through and through. This book is fast-paced, sexy, very romantic and a must-read for Jamie McGuire fans. \n Favorite quote: \n \"You can love someone without wanting to be with them.

If you are looking for a dark, smart and erotic story, then DO NOT DISTURB is the book for you. \n This book is the sequel to THE GIRL IN 6E, a fantastic and surprising story which I recommend that you read immediately!! The author continues the story of Deanna in DO NOT DISTURB and her story is intertwined with another character who might, just might, be as dark and disturbed as she is. But where Deanna tries her best to keep her dark nature hidden away and under control (barely), this new character does not. He is plain evil. The author has done a masterful job at building suspense and anticipation in this book and the plot twists are fantastic. This is a smart and twisted book and definitely NOT for the faint of heart. \n Deanna is faced with danger here in the form of an unhappy client. Will he outsmart the brilliant Deanna and pierce the layers of protection she has built of around her? Will Deanna finally find some semblance of normalcy with the sexy and understanding Jeremy? Once again, the author writes a brilliant story that answers all these questions without talking down to the reader and without coming to any false conclusions. The tensions are high and the sexy times are brilliantly erotic. I haven\'t stopped thinking about these characters! I amy dying (well, not literally) for another book in this series!! Don\'t miss DO NOT DISTURB, it is a must-read book that will keep you on the edge of your seat!! \n Favorite quote: \n \"Life is never a precious as when it is threatened.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(338, 38, 13, 5, 'Wow! Break the Sky is a brilliant, rich and SCORCHING hot storm of a story that will make new fans of Nina Lane. Kelsey and Archer were seen in the earlier Spiral of Bliss books but you do NOT have to read those books first (although they are fantastic and I highly recommend reading them NOW!!) One of my favorite couples, Dean and Liv, make an appearance here but the center of this amazing book is the stormy relationship between Kelsey and Archer. \n \"I swallowed to ease the dryness in my throat. \n \'Do you always let fate decisions for you?\' \n \'Fate makes better decisions than I do.\' \" \n Archer has always been a screw-up, an angry (and rightfully so), rootless man, drifting from job to job and never able to commit to much. He rides into the town of Mirror Lake already a changed man but his brother Dean only sees the old Archer, the addict and the womanizer. Enter Kelsey, the tightly-wound meteorology professor who needs to let go a little, and who knows that Archer is everything she should avoid. \n \"He could push me to my limits and protect me the entire time.\" \n Kelsey and Archer immediately strike a \"deal\", agreeing to a temporary relationship while he is visiting with Dean and Liv. Suffice it to say, they both get more than they bargained for and both learn to see behind the other\'s facade and get to what\'s real and honest. All of this plays out against the almost-fairytale-like setting of Mirror Lake, which adds a very special magic to this incredibly sexy and adult story. \n I must say that I absolutely love how Nina Lane can write about the world of college academics on the one hand and then turn around give us one of the dirtiest-talking characters EVER! (Phone sex, hello!) Archer is all man, commanding, bossy and completely honest with Kelsey. I found their relationship to be completely real and perfectly developed. I also loved the way Archer and Dean\'s relationship grew throughout this story, and the way Archer really matured and came to terms with his past. \n BREAK THE SKY is tender, sexy, funny and incredibly satisfying.

Gavin and Savannah are memorable, real and totally drew me into their story. \n I have not read the other books in the Last Call series so I can tell you that this one can absolutely be read as a standalone, but now that I have sampled Ms. Bennett\'s writing, I will read them. There are other characters from the previous books but they are fully-written characters and I did not feel as though I was lost at all. \n Gavin is in a lot of emotional pain and moves to North Carolina to finish writing a manuscript. He\'s sexy, British and has a very dark side. Savannah seems at first to be his total opposite - sweet, hard-working, yet smart and a little sassy. I literally read this book in one sitting and recommend it as a perfect read if you want a hot, sexy, funny, exciting and emotional story.

Confess is an intricately woven tale from beginning to end, where all of the characters are somehow connected and where everything is slowly revealed, little by little. \n I absolutely fell in love with Owen. He is a gifted artist but has some very rocky relationships in his life. I just knew that I would grow to love him even though he seemed like he made some questionable choices early on in the book. Owen and Auburn are both very, very complicated characters and my heart nearly broke for Auburn and her situation. I could not put this story down and read it in practically one sitting. \n \"I love you so much.\" His voice is breathless and full of fear. \"I\'ll love you forever. Even when I can\'t.\" My tears fall harder at his words. \"And I\'ll love you forever. Even when I shouldn\'t.\" \n You should read this book without any spoilers because the plot is very clever and there are surprises thrown in along the way. I love the creative plot and the paintings throughout the book are just magnificent. They tie into the story perfectly. I will confess that my ARC copy did not have the paintings so I bought a Kindle copy and I am so glad that I did. The paintings are haunting and very revealing. Even though this is a romantic story with some very emotional situations, there are definitely moments of humor which I greatly appreciated! \n Confess is another must-read from one of my absolute favorite authors. It is a beautiful story about the power of trust and love and I didn\'t want Owen and Auburn\'s story to end. Enjoy!'),

She has never really gotten over him and it seems that even though he broke up with her, he isn\'t over her, either. Melanie French writes sexy heroes who have a heart of gold, a strong romantic streak and who aren\'t afraid of strong women. The sex scenes in this book are UBER-hot and sweetly romantic at the same time. \n Sometimes you need a sexy, light and super-romantic book in between some of the darker, heavier reads, and Forked fits the bill perfectly.

They spend an incredibly HOT night together ((hello, ice cube scene!!), thinking they\'ll never see each other again, but boy, are they dead wrong. \n I fell in love with Lock, he is one bad-ass biker but he knows a good thing is right in front of him. The problem is, will he realize what a treasure Grace is before she slips away? \n \"I had my dream on my hands and in my mouth, and I never fucking realized.\" \n This story is perfectly told in both a combination of flashbacks and alternating POVs. The book unfolds like a flower petal, layer by layer peeled away until the reader is left incredibly satisfied at the end. This is a long and meaty book, filled with plenty of drama and scorching hot sex scenes, but I literally could not put it down until the very end. Ms. Porter has created a world of memorable characters, Alpha bikers, strong and feisty women and a solid story that will stay with me for a long time to come. \n I highlighted half the book but instead I am \"borrowing\" the author\'s teasers.

He seemed BAD through and through but I knew better! I couldn\'t wait to read his story because I knew there was much more to him. \n Vanquish totally blew me away. It is really a story of two painfully lonely people who really only want to connect with another human being on the most basic of levels. But this being a Pam Godwin story, well, you get two very effed up people, tons of mind-blowing sex, and lots of danger thrown into the mix. \n Pam Godwin\'s writing is pure perfection. There is no insta-connection, the emotions are real and the sexual chemistry is explosive. This book has it all. And Amber broke my heart. I am a huge Pam Godwin fan and I will devour every book she writes. Vanquish is raw, gritty, beautiful, suspenseful, sexy and painful. What more could you possibly ask for?'),

Jobs, friends, family, and yes, even all-seeing Clive all intervene into their blissful existence. \n I loved the way Simon and Caroline\'s relationship grows in this book. They learn more about each other and their witty banter is funny and realistic. Caroline has to make some tough decisions this book but all is done with good grace and humor. There is no over-the-top drama or contrived situations.

Tess and Q are both damaged, flawed and perfectly matched for each other. I adore this series and read this intense story almost in one sitting. \n Q was born into darkness, but he\'d never baptized me in his blackest desires. And because of that, I could implicitly say he spoke the truth. No matter what he did to me, he would never truly harm me. \n Told in dual POV\'s, this book is very, very dark and offers some BDSM along with the highly unusual relationship between Tess and Q.

Don\'t look cute, don\'t get undressed, and don\'t touch my underwear.\" \n I really loved the latest book in the Wild Seasons series! It is very, very funny, had really hot scenes and a wonderful storyline. Harlow is a funny, smart-ass, modern and smart heroine. Finn is another nuanced, sexy and loving leading man created by this fabulous writing duo. This is not a cliched contemporary romance story but instead has some very serious themes woven into the story. \n Harlow and Finn have lots of miscommunications throughout the story but their scenes together are fantastic and their chemistry feels real and genuine and never forced. I truly thought that the authors could not top the first book in this series but Harlow and Finn are every bit as addictive as the characters from Sweet Filthy Boy. \n These two are at opposite ends of the spectrum personality-wise but their banter and sexy times are hilarious and very, very hot. Don\'t miss this book. It is a wonderful, passionate and very funny read with lots and lots of heart. Can\'t wait for the next book in this series, Dark Wild Night, which will give us Lola and Oliver\'s story and is scheduled for release in 2015! \n (Thanks to the publisher for an ARC in return for an honest review.)'),

If you have waited until all the books are out in this series, well, wait no more! I highly recommend this highly imaginative and incredibly twisted series. All of the hype surrounding these books is very well-deserved, in my opinion. Nina/Elizabeth, Declan, Bennett, Pike...I grew to care deeply about each and every one. I will never forget this conclusion to this series. While I am saddended that this is the end of the series, I cannot wait to see what E.K. Blair dreams up next. \n If you have read the first two books, you know that Elizabeth has lived through unimaginable suffering. BANG, the first book in this series, is one of my top favorite books ever. The emotions, the thrills and the incredible darkness in that book left me reeling. The characters have come full circle here, and although the author certainly stays true to the dark nature of the series, the ending was perfect for these characters. \n \"We are monsters and lovers, animals and killers, but nothing can extinguish what we have when we\'re together.\" \n As I was coming to the ending of HUSH, I thought, \"Where is the author going with this? There are only a few more pages left! GAH!!\" E.K. Blair never takes the easy way out and she remained fiercely honest to each of her characters in this series. Sympathies will be challenged and emotions will be tested in HUSH. I am being vague because there is an incredibly risky and very surprising conclusion to this series and it must be experienced first-hand while reading, without knowing any spoilers. Don\'t skip to the end!! It has been days since I finished this book and these characters are still filling my head and my heart. Don\'t miss HUSH and don\'t miss the BLACK LOTUS Series.

She is also feisty, likable, curses all the time, and has some body issues. I loved her! The relationship between the two main characters is unpredictable and fresh. I also absolutely loved all the Slater Brothers and look forward to reading more about their exploits. \n This book is written in Irish dialect which the author explains right out of the box. I enjoyed it but it might be a little much for some readers to digest. This book is also hilarious and contains more F words than I think any book I have ever read. Dominic has some very endearing characters and totally hot sex scenes. I guarantee this book is different from any book you have read so far this year!

This story is the perfect combination of a smart, strong, witty heroine, a sexy, good-hearted bad boy, and a yummy story that is head and shoulders above most books in the genre. \n Even if you are not a fan of New Adult books, you will LOVE Scoring Wilder! Liam Wilder is a famous professional soccer player with a bad-boy reputation. Of course, much of it is due to the ever-present media and some undeserved bad press. Kinsley is a smart, driven, talented and FUNNY rising soccer star who immediately falls in lust with her new soccer coach. They are acutely aware that they are forbidden to be together, and Kinsley has some very, very funny moments when she is struggling to fight her growing attraction to her soccer coach. \n Oh - and Kinsley\'s previous relationships ended VERY badly so she doesn\'t trust anyone, let alone a tattoo-covered, world-famous soccer star. But Liam turns out to be a total sweetheart, romantic, honest, open and giving.

You might think you\'ve heard that before, but honestly, you have never read a story like PUSH before. I won\'t go into detail about the plot because this book is best read without knowing too much about the storyline. Going in blind to this book is so much more thrilling! \n Emma is moving on from her past and horrible stepfather and two brothers who were manipulated by him. She\'s had a rough life. She is starting over on her own, which is very freeing for her. She meets David they day she moves into her in apartment. He is the handyman for the building and was \"sent\" by the owner to fix her kitchen, which is a mess. She opens her door hesitantly, unsure of whether he\'s telling the truth or whether he is just a psycho. My anxiety attack began when she opened the door. You will need tranquilizers for this story!! It does end with a cliffhanger and I told myself, \"No! It can\'t end like this!\" But PUSH is so well-written that it is like a breath of fresh air.

For all of his very, very bad equalities, and there are many, he really loves Karissa and will let nothing stand in the way of keeping her safe. This is a very twisty story that begins in Book #1 and is part intense love story and part suspense story. \n Torture to Her Soul was a tiny bit slow for me midway through the story only because I have such high esteem for J.D. Darhower and her storytelling abilities. But the characters and the story are really fantastic and Mafia romances are one of my favorites genres. So I completely loved Naz, even when I hated him. \n This entire story is solely from Naz\'s POV and is a fascinating look inside his very dark mind. I could not wait for this conclusion to the incredible story from Monster in His Eyes and it did not disappoint. A must-read for all fans of darker romance. \n Favorite quote: \n \"I\'m not a good man,\" he says, \"but I\'m trying. I\'m trying. I can\'t make you any promises of perfection.

I always get what I want.

This is the first book I have read by S.L. Scott and I can\'t wait to read her other novels. \n I went into this blind and was drawn right into the fast-paced story of Holliday and Jack. Thank God for a smart, strong heroine! I am so tired of weak, cookie-cutter heroines and Holli was a breath of fresh air. She created her own business and the corporate side of this story was very realistic and not over-dramatized like many books have done lately. So thank you, Ms. Scott, for that. Holli doesn\'t need anyone, she\'s lonely but wrapped up in growing her business. So Jack Dalton is the last person she expects to fall for when she attends a convention in Las Vegas. \n They have immediate chemistry but he is actually a very sensitive, lonely guy who also looking for a deeper connection than his usual parade of one-night stands. \n Trust me, this book is so well-written that I lost myself in the words and read this in almost 1 day. I wish I would have read The Resistance slower! The storyline is also rich with other characters, and of course, lots and lots of hot sex. \n I must feel that the main characters are emotionally connected to each other, and the author succeeds on all levels. I as a reader also must feel a connection to the characters and I really cared about Jack and Holli. Their dialogue is witty, they both grow emotionally during the story, and I can\'t say anything negative at all about The Resistance. I absolutely love a rock star story that explores the perils of fame and excess, and this book also does that perfectly. A must-read by an author to watch!'),
(359, 41, 17, 5, '4.5 - 5 UNFORGETTABLE STARS!! \n If the mark of a good book is that you can\'t stop thinking about it, then CORRUPT is a winner. I love dark books but even I was close to not finishing this one due to the darkness and rage that filled the early part of the book. But what a story!!! Dark, sexy, thrilling, action-packed...and filled with twists and turns that took this cynical dark romance reader by surprise. \n Let me be clear that if Penelope Douglas wrote a grocery list, I would read it. BULLY is one of my favorite books and her new contemporary romance MISCOUNDUCT is one of the best books I\'ve read this year. So there\'s my disclaimer! \n If you are looking for a gripping, edge-of-your-seat book, then CORRUPT is for you. It is rough, it is scary, it is sexy...but it is ultimately incredibly thrilling and emotionally satisfying. And the sex scene near the end of the book? Holy moly. Kudos to you, Ms. Douglas, you thrilled even this jaded erotica reader. \n AS I was reading, I couldn\'t help but fear for Rika and the dire circumstances she found herself in. But she\'s an unusual female protagonist in that she literally could give as good as she got, and she never, ever once cowered or allowed herself to be overpowered by the \"Four Horsemen.\" I still think about all of these characters weeks after finishing this book. And that to me is what makes a good book great. \n CORRUPT is not your average dark romance. It is really a stand-out book. Highly, highly recommended. \n FAVORITE QUOTE: \n \"Redefine normal. None of us know the full measure of our power until we start pushing our boundaries and pressing our luck, and the more we do, the less we care what others think. The freedom feels too good.\"'),

He has very little to do with his mother, and had an abusive stepfather who was only interested in Sawyer\'s fame as a musician. He hasn\'t spoken to his best friend Jake since they were teenagers, when Sawyer could not deal with Jake making his true feelings known for Sawyer. \n Jake has followed Sawyer\'s career and is the only person who has ever really known the real Sawyer. He comes back into Sawyer\'s life as his bodyguard and is still very much in love with Sawyer. Now he just has to convince Sawyer that they belong together. The chemistry between these two is literally explosive and burns up the pages! I absolutely fell in love with Jake and his bossy, dominating ways. He cannot stay away from Sawyer, but will Sawyer admit his true feelings for Jake? \n This book is told in dual POV\'s which I thought worked great. There is a side plot involving death threats to the band but to me, it is the scorching hot sex scenes between Jake and Sawyer that made this book come alive. Nicola Haken is an incredibly talented writer and I devoured this book almost in one sitting. There is also a beautiful love story at the heart of this book and I was sad to see Jake and Sawyer\'s story end!

You know when you\'re reading and you\'re waiting for a disaster to happen? That was me. I empathized with the main character right from the Prologue. This is my kind of book - Louis is 30, wealthy, hot, a womanizer with a really foul mouth. What more can you ask for? Emily is 18 years old and meets Louis while filling in as a waitress for her sister\'s catering job. She can\'t keep her eyes off this magnetic man, who has every women salivating for him.

Louis hired her sister\'s company for more parties. She find out it\'s him and signs up to work the jobs. Louis approaches her and lets her know how he can\'t stop thinking about her, and how much he wants her. They go out for coffee and dinner but he is so cocky that she sets him straight, and from there on he switches because he realizes just because she\'s young, she\'s not a push over. Their obsession for each grows, they can\'t be without each other. They are consumed with one another. She lives for only him. He changes his lifestyle for her, stops sleeping around and breaks up the the \"boys\", his best friends. \n Will his past interfere, and her insecurities doom them? \n The sex scenes were great.

But their bond is so strong and passionate, that I just knew that they would be able to withstand any heartache and pain that came their way. I feel very strongly about the type of \"community\" that Eden and Calder lived in, and many scenes were almost too painful to read.

This story unfolds layer by layer, with the reader joining in Calder\'s slowly dawning realization that he and his family did NOT, in fact, live in a paradise. \n \"We hadn\'t chosen this life. It had chosen us.\" \n Calder and Eden\'s love is almost magical. But there is plenty of off-the-charts heat and longing between them to satisfy every contemporary romance reader.

One Night: Promised is a 6-star read for me and it is NOT to be missed. \n Livy is a very relatable woman, a bit of an underachiever but working hard to put her past dysfunctional family life behind her.

He makes her feel alive, BUT she does push back at certain points in the story which I found to be very believable and true to her character.

I also loved the emotional connection between the characters, and Cal\'s inner dialogue. He came across as surprisingly thoughtful and sweet, an interesting mix with his Dom tendencies. \n This is a fantastic addition to the Market Garden series and I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a gutsy, sexy and surprisingly emotional love story.'),
(372, 42, 30, 5, 'Tessa Bailey is known for writing the dirtiest-talking Alphas around. This book was released under Entangled Embrace, so it\'s not quite as dirty but I absolutely loved it! This is Willa and Shane\'s story. Willa first appeared in \'Protecting What\'s His\', from the author\'s Line of Duty series, and I have been looking forward to her story ever since we met Ginger\'s younger sister. \n Willa has won a photography contest and the prize is a trip to Ireland. She has broken up with her boyfriend and is tortured over whether she did the right thing. She is met at the airport by her ride to the bed-and-breakfast, none other than the handsome, sexy and apparently very angry Shane. He is none to happy to be burdened with fetching Willa from the airport and they immediately argue. She stands up to him, which most people do not do, and fireworks ensue. \n Unfixable is a sexy, layered and nuanced story that captured my attention from the beginning to end. Tortured, sexy Irishman with a soft heart? Check. Beautifully described Irish locales? Check. Troubled, insecure and beautiful heroine? Check! Add some really hot and sexy times and you have a perfect romance novel. \n The characters are all incredibly well-written, Shane and Willa both have issues that they must come to terms with, and above it all, this book has real heart. I absolutely love Tessa Bailey\'s books and will read anything this woman writes. If you want a perfect escapist story, then Unfixable is the book for you.'),

I really didn\'t expect to love Sweet Filthy Boy as much as I did, but the story and the characters drew me right in and this book far exceeded my expectations. \n This book starts out with a twist and builds from there. Mia and her friends go to Las Vegas after college graduation as a gift from the parents of one of the friends. Mia is determined to let loose for a weekend before she follows her father\'s wishes and heads off the graduate business school in Boston. She gets more than she bargained for after one wild night with the gorgeous, sexy but oh-so-sensitive Ansel, who is visiting from France. \n Mia decides to spend the summer with Ansel in France. This book really transports the reader to the different locales and I loved being lost in the story. Las Vegas, San Diego, Paris... the cities each almost became another character in the book. I absolutely fell in love with Ansel and the sexy times in this story are SMOKING HOT, off the charts! The writing is perfection and I want to get to know all of the characters better! \n I really wasn\'t sure how this book was going to turn out, and I was glued to the pages until the very end. I loved this book, I loved Ansel and can\'t wait for more in this series! \n (Copy provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

There are so many completely made-up details in this story that would never, ever happen in real life (and would land the main characters in a real courtroom) that it made it very difficult for me to enjoy the sexy and engaging banter between the two main characters. I did love the alternating POV\'s but the glaring inaccuracies in this story aggravated the hell out of me. This is pure, escapist fantasy, that can be read in just one sitting. The author does a great job at establishing an emotional connection between the characters and I definitely will read the next installment.'),

This review will be very vague on details because Bang absolutely must be read without any spoilers - this story will simply take you on a wild roller coaster ride from start to finish. \n All of these author\'s books are beautifully written but in my opinion, Bang is the best book she has written so far. I don\'t know where she dreamed up this storyline from, but it is gripping, erotic, gut-wrenching, suspenseful and incredibly creative all at once. I fell in love with all of the characters, and was blown away by the fantastic story. \n Bang is an absolute must-read! It is highly erotic and very, very dark. And yes, the ending will totally leave you guessing as to what happens next.

Slow Burn was nothing that I expected from Ms. Bromberg, and it totally took me by surprise and blew me away!! \n Ah, Becks and Haddie. If you think you know them from the Driven Trilogy, you will see them in a whole new light in Slow Burn. With that being said, this book can absolutely be read and enjoyed as a standalone. Becks and Haddie had one night together and he knows in his heart that he won\'t be able to stay away from Haddie, even though she presents a tough-as-nails exterior to the world. He sees the real her. I read this book literally on the edge of my seat and I have never appreciated Ms. Bromberg\'s brand of humor more! \n Favorite quotes: \n \"Time is precious. Waste it wisely.\" \n \"I just figured you were having some regression pussy.\" \n \"Whenever I don\'t want to deal..., I go and have meaningless sex to not think about it. \'Slut glut, I believe is my term for it.\" \n \"Slow burn, my ass. More like fire in the goddamn hole.\" \n \"Goddmann estrogen vortex.\" \n Slow Burn will make you laugh, cry and SWOON. It\'s a must-read and is destined to become another beloved contemporary romance from K. Bromberg.'),

And that is exactly the way I felt when reading EASY VIRTUE. This book drew me in, grabbed me and didn\'t let go! I read this incredibly HOT book almost in one sitting. Blaire seems unlikeable, cold and calculating from the outside, but she really is a product of her sad childhood and massive insecurities that have shaped her adult life. Is she really capable of real love? I think so but you have to read this gem of a book for yourself to find out. \n I absolutely fell in love with Ronan, he seems the perfect match for Blaire and he might be the one to show her true love. There are lots of twists and turns in this book and it should be read without reading any spoilers. It is the kind of book that warrants a re-read because there are hints dropped here and there about the future of the story. Make no mistake, this is an incredibly sexy and fast-paced read, and will have you turning the pages until the very end. My only complaint: I NEED MORE RONAN, NOW!! Highly recommended!! \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(379, 42, 54, 5, '5+++ stars! Rex took my breath away. A must-read! \n This incredible book begins with this beautiful dedication: \n \"To every child who waited for a savior that never came.\" \n You don\'t need to be a fan of fighter books to absolutely cherish this heartbreaking and ultimately incredibly uplifting story of Rex and Georgia. Fighting for Flight is one of my top reads so far of 2014 and stayed with me long after I finished. \n This book paints a vividly detailed picture of the heartbreaking pasts of Rex and Georgia. He was in foster care with her, but he had a nightmarish childhood that haunts him in expected ways as an adult. He is troubled both sexually and emotionally and can never quite put his finger on what is at the root of his problems. He does know that he is attracted to the somewhat elusive new friend. \n Rex is both a singer in a band and a fighter. While he can\'t recall his childhood, she holds the key to his past, and while she is desperately trying to correct her past mistakes, and alleviate some of the crushing guilt she has carried with her for her entire life, she doesn\'t always go about it in the best way. Assumptions are made, hearts are broken, beautiful words are spoken...and during this incredible book, I absolutely fell in love with Rex. \n \"The pain. It\'s the only thing that reminds me I\'m alive. When most of the time I wish I were dead.\" \n Georgia understands Rex on a very deep and intimate level and their scenes together are breathtaking! I was blown away by the incredible intimacy and deep emotional connection Ms. Salsbury created between the two characters, a connection that is often missing for me in most books. \n The author doesn\'t try to gloss over Rex\'s horrific childhood. His present-day obsessive-compulsive disorder is honestly dealt with and very detailed. I loved the fact that Rex was also a musician and his lyrics are testament to the author\'s incredible writing talent and creativity: \n Vivid dreams, different faces \n Waves of hate and lust in traces \n Festering sickness, my insides rot \n There\'s no pill for what I\'ve got. \n Fighting to Forget is a must-read. It has steam, unforgettable characters, a heartbreaking storyline, intensity, creativity and emotion. Do not miss this one!! Jamie Salsbury has become my new 1-click author and I can\'t wait for more books in this series. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(380, 42, 16, 5, 'This dark and fantastic story completely and utterly thrilled me and captivated me from the very first page. Our heroine Nila is a successful fashion designer, although she has led a somewhat sheltered life (which actually plays quite nicely into the storyline). On the night of her big runway show, she encounters Jethro Hawk and she senses immediately that her life will change. And does it ever. \n \"That was my last day of freedom. The last day that was my own.\" \n As a huge Pepper Winters fan, I absoultely loved this mind-f* of a story and the dark elements did not disturb me, but only enthralled me. It seems as though the demanding Jethro has no redeeming qualities, but I feel there are hints of much more to come about this mysterious man in the future installments. He fascinated me. The story is quite twisty and yes, somewhat fantastical, but this is a true page-turner, no doubt about it. \n \"One mistake six hundred years ago put a curse on her entire family. One mistake sold her life to me in a mountain of unpayable debt. I inherited her. I preyed on her. I owned her life and had the piece of paper to prove it.\" \n I absolutely loved this book and urge you to give it a try. Yes, there is a cliffhanger but the story is so well-written, it is truly one of a kind ad not to be missed.'),
(381, 42, 21, 5, '6 stars. Absolute perfection!! \n Seriously, how can I even begin to discuss a book that has shot to the top of my list of favorite books ever? Colleen Hoover has written another magical, perfect story that will grab your heartstrings and will not let go until the very end. I have to make this review intentionally vague because there is a major plot twist in Maybe Someday that must be experienced first-hand and should not be known before you start reading this book. \n \"Sometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.\" \n Truer words were never spoken. Sydney and Ridge\'s story was like nothing I have read before. And Maybe Someday is SO much more than just a book, there is a gorgeous soundtrack that accompanies the story and makes this an unforgettable reading and listening experience. \n Ridge is hands-down my new favorite book boyfriend. Ms. Hoover has taken a familiar genre, and created an imaginative and unexpected story that surprised and thrilled me and left me with a serious book hangover after finishing. This book is perfection and it is an absolute must-read!! \n (ARC obtained from NetGalley)'),

I read a lot of m/m books and Always was a refreshingly different and wonderful story! I was hooked from the first glance between Avery and Kane and read this beautifully written book almost in one sitting. \n Although I am not a fan of insta-love, the author handled the stunning attraction between Avery and Kane in a fantastic way in Always. Once these two met, there was no turning back. \n \"Kane could feel his soul being extracted from his body. His heart followed, no longer his own, but given to this man he didn\'t even know. In a matter of a few short minutes, he had become one with this man in from of him.\" \n These two embark on a wonderful journey together and Ms. Alexander handles their lives with beauty and grace. Oh, and the sex scenes are absolutely some of the steamiest I have ever read. These two have a chemistry that jumps right off the page! I needed a cold shower after reading this book. I\'ll keep this review spoiler-free, because there are some major surprises that I did not see coming and this book should be read without knowing the plot twists. \n Even if you are not a fan of the m/m contemporary romance genre, I highly recommend giving this book a try. It is lushly written and completely satisfying in terms of the emotional connection between the two main characters. I fell in love with Kane and Avery and I already miss them! I can\'t wait to read more of Kindle Alexander\'s books!'),

We first met Ridge in Wild (Book #1) but this is a standalone book, and you do not need to read Wild first. \n Ridge slept with his brother\'s fiancee Mia, but they really never intended to hurt anyone. They really love each other but Ridge is consumed by guilt over his relationship with his brother, so he suddenly breaks up with Mia in an effort to repair his relationship with his brother. Ridge battled addictions most of his life, and breaking up with Mia sends him into a downward spiral. He had a very, very rough past, including drugs and spending time in juvenile detention, among other things. \n Ridge has now become a successful restaurant owner but his pain over Mia pulls him into a very, very dark place. He tries to have other relationships but no one can compare to Mia. Even when he was a jerk to everyone, I loved him! He was never intentionally hurtful and really wanted to make things right. \n Mia had every right not to care about Ridge, but even after he broke her heart, she really tries to do the right thing. I loved how she was a multi-dimensional character and seemed very \"real\" to me. \n Oh, and the sex! It is HOT AS HELL . I mean, really dirty, scorching hot sex scenes. I applaud you Ms. Wild! I literally read this book in a few hours. It is the kind of book where you can\'t tear your eyes away from what is happening in front of you. If you like a down-and-dirty story with flawed characters, you will love Ridge. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(384, 43, 33, 5, '\"Love. What else is love, if not the power to destroy?\" \n After Dark brings the fantastically addictive Night Owl trilogy to an incredibly satisfying conclusion. And what a finale it is! We are now witness to the somewhat \"normal\" living arrangements of Matt and Hannah as they return to real life after the tumultuous events of the first two books. Their relationship continues to be beautifully sexy, erotic and passionate. Make no mistake, After Dark is incredibly hot, dirty and lusty. Matt is irresistible! If not very maddening. \n \"...little secrets are like water, but if water gets into a rock and freezes, it can break the rock.\" \n Hannah and Matt both struggle in After Dark to reach a level of closeness and honesty that is sometimes brutal to witness yet real, honest and emotional. I love how both Matt and Hannah have grown and matured over the course of the trilogy, without one false note. The plot in the final book is refreshing and a complete page-turner. I will admit that I am distraught that this trilogy has ended (one of my all-time favorites, hands down), but I was absolutely entranced by the conclusion and the Epilogue. After Dark is a moody, erotic, sensual story that is a must-read book. Fingers crossed for many more books from the extraordinarily talented M. Pierce! \n (ARC provided by the publisher with thanks.)'),
(385, 44, 46, 5, '4.5 stars!! There is nothing quite like an Abbi Glines book. I absolutely love the Florida Panhandle settings, the always-surprising and juicy story lines, and the steamy, sexy scenes. Of course I LOVE Rush and Blaire, so I was excited to read more about Grant from the Rosemary Beach series. \n And even though I am not filled with hate for Nan (sorry, I can see a little, tiny bit of good in everyone!) I was completely on Harlow\'s side in this super-sexy installment in the Rosemary Beach series. \n Leave it to Abbi Glines to give us yet another absolutely irresistible, surprisingly thoughtful leading man in Grant. The sweet and beautiful Harlow didn\'t have a chance with Grant around. I loved getting inside Grant\'s head to learn what his possible motivations could be in sleeping with Nan. And the alternating POV\'s work perfectly in this story. \n Abbi Glines knows how to write some hot and dirty scenes and that\'s exactly what you get in Take A Chance. Along with the dramatic twists and turns (especially near the end), and the very alluring characters, I could not put this book down. I absolutely cannot wait for more Grant and Harlow!! \n Favorite Quote: \n \"I can\'t fight this. I don\'t fucking want to,\" he finished, then both his hands landed on each side of my head. \"Come with me,\" he whispered, and I broke apart into a million pieces.

The story of how Kate blossoms once she arrives in Napa Valley for her latest assignment had me hooked and I read this fabulous book almost in one sitting. The chemistry between Kate and Jamie was real and relatable to me and I fell in love with the California and Chicago settings of this story. \n Kate is in a ho-hum relationship with a boyfriend who really doesn\'t even pay that much attention to her. and decides to leap at the chance to interview a reclusive tech millionaire at his winery in Napa Valley. She has learned to rely on only herself, which is kind of poignant and sad. \n \"I\'m all I\'ve got.\" \n Jamie is one of the winery workers and let\'s just say he brings Kate out of her shell. \n \"Food is like love,you know?\" \n \"Yes,\" I said breathlessly. \n \"We need it to stay alive.\" \n There is so much more to this story, and it is a richly written, lovely romance that left me wanting more! There are spoilers to this story, and no, I didn\'t see them coming, unlike other readers. I absolutely loved the characters and the story took my breathe away.

(387, 44, 34, 5, 'FRENCHED was a deliciously sexy, fun and funny romantic story!! I read this in one day and was literally transported to the City of Light in this wonderfully written and HOT story. \n Mia is almost left at the altar (her fiancee calls off the wedding a week before by text message) and she is completely depressed, especially since she is an event planner and used to making detailed, well-thought-out lists for EVERYTHING (even down to the outfits she is going to wear each day). \n \"Top Five Reasons (Out of 100) I Am NEVER Coming Out Of This Blanket Fort\" \n Mia is not a spontaneous person at all but ends up traveling alone to Paris on what would have been her honeymoon. What sounds like it might be a cliche story turns out to be SO much more as she meets a scruffy bartender, Lucas, who makes a bet with her that leads to them sightseeing together all over the city. \n This is a very, very funny book and is told from Mia\'s POV. It is a total escapist story and I absolutely loved every minute of it. Lucas is smart, kind, sensitive and not at all like the type of man Mia thought she would be attracted to. He breaks all the molds but he, too, has some hang-ups of his own. \n Their chemistry is AMAZING, and I wanted more, more, more!! This is a standalone book but I will say that I really would like to read more of Lucas and Mia\'s story. There is also a wonderful supporting cast of characters so maybe we will read more about them in the future? (Hint, hint!) \n This is a perfect, sexy little gem of a book. I highly recommend it. \n (Copy provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

This book will draw you right in from the very powerful prologue right through to the very end. Kylie and Cooper are a young married couple who have suffered an almost unimaginable loss. Unfortunately, their mutual grief almost leads to their complete self-destruction as a couple. \n At first I could not understand why they continued to torture each other but the author writes in such a way that I fell in love with both characters and with their mutual best friend Grayson. These are not perfect people and they make lots of mistakes along the way. At a few points, I almost could not stand the way Cooper and Kylie treated each other -- but then the author gives us flashbacks so you can\'t help but understand and even sympathize why they are so shattered, but yet so joined together \n \"We share a reckless, toxic love that feeds the brokenness in me, in us. Our love is an addiction. A love that I won\'t ever consider living without.\" \n Against All Odds is an outstanding debut novel from Angie McKeon. There are plenty of steamy sexy times but also tons of emotion and a really creative story that makes this book stand out from the crowd of contemporary romances.

Blood Mate is a FAIRY TALE, not really an erotic romance in any way, and is another intense story from Kitty Thomas. I don\'t normally read this genre of books but I absolutely loved the writing and the characters and am so glad I had the opportunity to read this book. \n August is a very powerful vampire who is cursed to forever take human victims on order to ensure his own survival. He was a good man in his former life and he desperately wants to break his curse. To do this, he must find his \"blood mate\", a woman whom he cannot \"enthrall\" or control via her mind, and who will stay with him throughout eternity. \n August finds Nicole, who is actually very happily married. Through a series of twists and turns, August creates a situation where Nicole will become his blood mate, but she doesn\'t give in so easily, and is a very strong and feisty heroine. August is torn by his actions but he absolutely must ensure his own survival. \n Only Kitty Thomas could create a cast of strong characters like those in Blood Lust and an fantastically creative story that will keep you guessing until the very end. \n If you want to step outside your usual genre of books, I highly recommend this dark and sensual tale. You will not be disappointed. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(390, 44, 70, 5, '4.5 stars!! \n Therapy is an absolutely beautifully written book that explores very sensitive topics of depression, bullying, self-harming and addiction in an unflinching way, but without ever dragging the reader down or making the situations too unbearable. Jessica has a tormented life, but I was cheering for her and I loved the way the author really got inside this young girl\'s mind. Jace comes to her rescue, but he is certainly no cookie-cutter hero and battles demons of his own throughout the book. \n The time span of this book is wide and it is a rich story filled with unforgettable characters. There are some major \"oh wow\" moments so I\'ll keep this review spoiler-free. Jessica is tormented relentlessly by bullies in high school. She battles depression and engages in self-harming (very graphically depicted) and makes some other very poor choices that will come back to haunt her later. Jace is the quintessential popular high school jock who befriends Jess and their friendship grows into a deep and lasting love. \n But nothing is ever easy for Jess, so this is not a hearts-and-flowers love story between her and Jace. The author writes a wonderfully detailed story and it should be read without knowing the plot spoilers! This is a must-read book for its sensitivity, writing and creativity.

I have read Ella Frank\'s books and she is a gifted and talented writer but I wasn\'t sure where she\'d go with this genre. Well, she totally took me by surprise with Tate and Logan! I LOVED their story and highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates lots of steam, an emotional story, and well-written, engaging characters. The story is wonderful and my heart broke a little for Tate as he struggled with coming out to his family.. \n I absolutely loved Logan\'s confident, take-charge personality. He is very comfortable in his own skin. And the chemistry between these two is unmistakable. I recommend reading Try first - you can read Take as a standalone but the characters and story are more meaningful if you \"begin at the beginning\". I did find the main characters to be just a little chatty at some points, but Ms. Frank more than makes up for that with absolutely off-the-charts sex scenes that are incredibly erotic.

I absolutely loved City - could he be ANY hotter?? - and the object of his lust, the very endearing schoolteacher, Suzy (or Suzette, City likes to use her real name and not her nickname). Often I read erotic romance that is rushed, empty, almost soulless, and Throttle Me is the compete opposite: a steamy, tattooed hot guy who has had his share of meaningless hook-ups but who has a real sense of romance, love and family. \n Tattooed, motorcycle-riding Alpha bad boy? Check. Smart, hard-working, sweet woman who is just getting her first taste of really mind-blowing sex? Check. Well-written cast of supporting characters? Check! (Hello, Gallo brothers!) There are no billionaires here, no young, blushing virgin.

Our hero Jack is a classic alpha male, in fact, he\'s the town sheriff and basically falls for Jenn immediately and claims her as his own. He is very sexy and I loved his no-nonsense, blunt, plain-speaking character. \n \"I\'m not 9-5 suit material; I wear jeans; I hunt bad guys, and I rescue damsels in distress.\" \n Jenn has had several major upheavals in her life and ends up relocating to the town of Gunnison in the Colorado mountains. I liked that our heroine is not 22 years old but instead is old enough to have a daughter in college. Much action and drama ensue once Jenn arrive in town, and the best part for me was the romance and the very, very hot and steamy sex scenes between Jenn and Jack. There is also a crime/mystery story involved which puts Jenn in peril throughout much of the book. \n There is no question that this book is cut from the same mold as Kristen Ashley\'s stories. The author clearly and admittedly is a fan of KA. If you like a growling alpha male with a good heart and a feisty heroine, you will love this book. The story had some editing and grammar issues which troubled me but if the author can tighten those up, I am very much looking forward to her next book! \n This is a standalone and I loved the ending and prologue.'),

This book then explores Sophia and Jack\'s past, and what a surprise it is! \n I loved this book. The author has a witty, fast-paced way of writing, and these characters stayed with me after I finished both these books. I read Savage Delight in one sitting and I can\'t wait for Book 3! \n Favorite quote: \n \"The sadness will last forever. And I think he was right, but I also think he was very, very wrong.

(398, 46, 2, 5, 'I read this funny, very sexy, smart and very unique book in one sitting. The writing style is very different and fresh, written mostly in the form of diary entries. Emma is a smart and ambitious corporate employee and becomes personal assistant to the imposing Alaric Canon, who has burned through so many PA\'s that he is the subject of office betting pools. The jerk-y boss/subservient assistant has been done before, but never like this! Emma has a plan to get Alaric to notice her but he is perpetually challenging and sets standards that are basically impossible for his assistants to meet. Emma\'s inner monologue is hilarious, as she deals with his demanding and dominating personality: \n \"Life\'s a bitch, and she has several sisters.\" \n This girl has a plan to get Alaric to notice her, but her best-laid plans go wildly awry when the two take a tension-filled business trip and basically spend 24/7 together. Emma rises to Alaric\'s challenges time after time, and I absolutely loved the slow build-up to their incredible sexy times together: \n \"Denim in long expanses. Barely contours to his thighs. Thighs I have leaned against but not touched. Bare feet. \n Barefoot! Put some shoes on, already! How am I supposed to look unaffected and asexual \n with all this unfair fuckery happening?\" \n Emma is completely self-deprecating and really holds no illusions about the possibilities of a relationship with Alaric. I mean, he is rarely seen with the same woman twice. \n \"God, I\'m not in just in the neighborhood of pathetic, I\'m circling the block.\" \n Alaric really grows and develops and begins to show a more human side and I loved that he was not just a one-dimensional character. My heart was literally in my throat by the end of the book. Qwen\'s writing style is incredibly fresh and unique and is a most welcome addition to the contemporary erotic romance genre. I adored the conclusion and I am demanding more from this author! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),

(400, 46, 94, 4, 'I am a big fan of Scott Hidlreth\'s writing style (his Baby series is fantastic, and I highly recommend the books) so I was excited to read Undefeated. This book is written in a raw, take-no-prisoners style which is refreshing and different. This is not the usual damaged-hero-and-heroine story but instead is a real, gritty portrayal of two people who have endured suffering and abuse (graphically portrayed, so be warned) but who manage to come together and yes, fall in love. \n Kace has what can only be described as severe social anxiety disorder and it\'s a miracle she even could hold a conversation with Shane, let alone let him love her. And Shane is surprisingly introspective, tender and loving, despite his sad background. \n Undefeated contains what I thought to be very realistic and detailed fighting scenes which are really written in a different style than the fighter books I have previously read, I guess due to the author being male. The erotica in this book comes a little later in the story, but is super-steamy and sexy nonetheless. \n If you are looking for a book that is written in a very raw style with very real people, then I recommend Undefeated. And please heed the author\'s warning about the violence, it\'s very, very graphic! And give his Baby series a try, you will love them. \n (ARC provided the author in exchange for an honest review.)'),
(401, 46, 17, 5, 'LOVE, IN ENGLISH is an absolutely magnificent, gorgeously written and totally captivating contemporary romance from Karina Halle. I think that every reader\'s own hopes, fears and dreams color their perception of a book, and to say that I was blown away by Vera Miles being an astronomy student is a mild understatement. I was completely fascinated from Page 1 with our heroine Vera, a whip-smart, unique, insecure beauty who marches to the beat of a different drummer. Thank you, Karina, for a heroine who\'s real, flawed, emotional and, in the end, very open to love. \n This book transported me to Spain with its sexy and romantic story of Mateo and Vera, two mismatched lovers thrown together by chance. Vera is a young Canadian college student who takes a temporary summer job in Spain, to provide English-only conversation to Spanish attendees. Mateo is a handsome, married ex-footballer, well-known in Europe and older than Vera but quite discontent with his life. Their love builds slowly, beautifully, painfully and with tons and tons of off-the-charts chemistry. \n While in Spain, Vera learns to slow down, appreciate life and be in the moment. The scenes between her and Mateo are absolutely breathtaking and almost painfully beautiful. He sees her inner and outer beauty, and in his eyes, she is a bright and shining star. His \"Estrella\". \n \"Design your own universe, make your own stars, write your own stories and create your own destiny.\" \n This is not a book where the decisions of the hero and heroine are made lightly or without thought to the consequences. I really felt Mateo\'s agony as he struggled to do the right thing but to also follow his heart and live his life to the fullest. Love, in English is ultimately a beautifully written journey of two very different people who fall madly in love. If you care about such things, this is a standalone book but you will be sad for it to end! I leave you with my favorite quote from Love, in English, and the unqualified recommendation that you read this book. You will love it! \n \"What is love? In English.\" \n I raised my brows. \"Love, in English, is love...\" \n \"What is it in Spanish? \n I was so enthralled by his hypnotic eyes, I could barely remember. \"Amore?\" \n He shook his head ever so slightly. \"No. Love in Spanish is you.\"'),

This is one of those books where the title really says it all. \n I LOVE menage books and Shayla Black has written one of the most memorable menage stories I have ever read. With the fantastic D/s elements, this is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. Nothing is rushed and I felt an emotional connection with the characters. I loved everything about this book! Shayla Black has become one of my go-to authors for erotic romance.

I absolutely fell in love with Archer, he has suffered unimaginable trauma and is closed off from the world. Along comes Bree and awakens his long-dormant feelings and his abilities to possibly become a whole person again. Archer is an intense, sometimes difficult character and my heart broke for him.

I will admit that the first part of this book was a \"slow burn\" for me, there was no rushing into romance but instead Ms. Hunting slowly reveals the badly damaged souls of Hayden and Tenley. But then WOW, the author writes some amazingly hot sex scenes, which are very much infused with love and caring and an emotional connection between the characters. Hayden and Tenley both have secrets they are afraid to share with each other, even though it becomes clear they are falling in love. \n Hayden is seriously hot and really tries to show his vulnerable side to Tenley. But she is both emotionally and physically scarred and keeps pushing him away. \n \"Everyone has scars, Tenley. If we\'re lucky, they\'re only on the outside.\" Hayden \n I ended up falling in love with both these characters by the end and I can\'t wait for the next book in this series!

I did not read any reviews of this book before I started reading it and I am so glad I had no idea about this story other than the synopsis, so I will keep this spoiler-free. Pepper has created two of the most memorable characters I have ever read and even now I can\'t stop thinking about Hazel and Fox. \n This is a dark, dark journey, but hold out and keep reading because the author makes it worth your while. Our hero and heroine meet under very harsh circumstances and their story is a raw, gritty and emotional journey like no other. Yes, the sex scenes are incredibly steamy, but they are infused with a rawness and pain that is at times difficult to witness: \n \"It was the best kiss I\'d ever received, but also the worst. It sparked lust and need in every inch of me. My lips wanted more, my tongue wanted savagery. My skin wanted to bruise because he needed to touch me so badly. \n All my thoughts disappeared as I nipped at his bottom lip. He flinched, but a second later he copied, his sharp canines piercing my oversensitive flesh. \n I moaned. \n I couldn\'t take it. \n My hands flew up and gripped his shirt. Yanking him toward me, fireworks whizzed in my fingertips; my heart galloped toward exploding with lust. I\'d never been so drunk on someone before. \n Then I landed flat on my back. \n The crack of my skull jangled my teeth. The thick carpet did little to cushion me. My eyes flared wide and I grunted in pain. Fear, hot and terrible, swamped my lust in a dampening wave. \n \"Top rule. Unbreakable rule. Don\'t. Ever. Touch. Me.\" Fox kneeled on one knee beside my head, breathing hard. His hand noosed my throat, pressing my spine into the carpet. His eyes were cold and lifeless, looking like a hunter intent on blood.\" - HAZEL \n My heart went out to both of them and especially Fox, he was a fighter, hiding his fractured soul behind a stony, murderous facade: \n \"Fox made a sound in the back of his throat, tightening his fingers. He glared, looking ready to murder me. \"Who are you?\" His eyes darted over me as if looking for an answer. \n When I didn\'t respond, he swiped his face with his other hand. His forehead furrowed while his expression turned pissed and stormy. \"You think I didn\'t see you watching? You had your eyes all over me. Answer me. Who the fuck are you?\" His deep, accented voice stiffened my nipples even as a thrill of fear jolted through me. \n My temper gave me false courage. \"I\'m not in the habit of answering such rude questions.\" -- HAZEL \n I absolutely loved the dual POV\'s, which are very difficult to do well, but Pepper does an amazing job at getting the reader into these character\'s heads. Destroyed was an absolute 5-star read for me. I do hope, however, that the small editing and grammatical will be corrected. Otherwise, Destroyed is another fantastic and completely original story from the very talented Pepper Winters. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

Joss is trying to move on with her life after the sudden death if her beloved husband. Little does she know that his best friend Dash has always been in love with her but never acted on his feelings out of loyalty to his best friend and Joss\' husband. Sparks literally fly when she walks into Dash\'s D/s club one night, and he realizes she is looking to be in a submissive relationship. He is shocked but thrilled at the possibility of a relationship with her. \n Maya Banks can write hot and steamy sex scenes like nobody\'s business! Wowser! What was beautiful about the story is that Dash and Joss had a deep connection before they have sex and there is a slow and gradual build-up to their scenes together. I loved when Joss really \"saw\" Dash for the first time as a man and a sexual partner, instead of the best friend of her husband. It was breathtaking. \n The sex scenes are totally hot and the anal play scenes are absolutely among the hottest I have ever read! There is a fabulous Epilogue and no cliffhanger, but there will definitely be more books in this series about Joss and Dash\'s friends. Can\'t wait for more from Maya Banks! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(407, 46, 38, 4, 'The Madam is a highly sexually intense and erotically-charged story of power, sex and control. Is there love? Yes, there is, in a way. The story of Lilith and her rise to become the powerful and influential head of a high-class call-girl operation is tragic at times and always gripping. Her mother trains her in the ways of the lifestyle, and Vivian will certainly not win any Mother of the Year awards. But she is sure of a woman\'s power and never lets her daughter forget it. \n This story spans several decades and is filled with some of the most intense sexual scenes I have ever read. Menage, light BDSM, young girls experiencing their first sexual awakenings, this book has it all. All of the characters spanning the years are fascinating, and the Miami drug scene in the eighties and nineties provides a dangerous backdrop to the main story. \n M. Robinson has an interesting way of writing where she takes you literally through the life and the mind of the main characters. It is a layered and very rich story, and not exactly for the faint of heart. Ms. Robinson is extremely talented and certainly can bring on the angst! Just please note that this book contains some very graphic erotic scenes and if that is your cup of tea, then you will love The Madam. \n (ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.)'),

Ream is explosive and sexy, but he is harboring some terrible secrets that cause him to turn off emotionally and push Kat away. Kat herself is keeping a huge secret from Ream and the book turns on some major misunderstandings between the two of them. \n The band is back home after being on tour and Ream aggressively pursues Kat. She can\'t deny his larger-than-lfe personality and his aggressive alpha tendencies. I loved this sexy, hot rocker but much of the story is spent with Kat denying her true feelings for him. I absolutely loved the two of them together, and they have incredibly explosive chemistry. \n The story felt a little rushed toward the end, with several plot threads coming together and very crucial characters all appearing at the end of the story. I love dark reads but the darker elements felt a little forced, and I would have loved a little more background on some of the characters that shaped Ream\'s life. The best parts of the story were when Ream opened up emotionally about his past, I really felt connected to him and Kat during those moments in the story. My heart broke for Ream and what he endured in his past and I loved how he overcame these horrible obstacles so that he could be what Kat needed. \n I loved all of the friends and bandmates and look forward to reading about Georgie and Deck.

(409, 46, 11, 4, 'This is an action-packed, mafia-themed book with some romance that includes a hint of a classic love triangle. The story is told from multiple POVs which can be a little disorienting but which does give insight into the three main guy characters. I loved the chemistry between Nixon and Trace but I needed more romance! Their scenes together were sizzling but not explicit. This book explores the inner workings of mafia families and if you like mob stories, then you will love that part of the plot. There are a lot of secondary characters here, as well as lots of betrayals and violence...in short, a good look into the uncertain and tough world of crime families. \n I am interested to see where Chase\'s story goes and hope there will be more written about him! I loved his scenes with Trace. Rachel Van Dyken is an excellent writer and there is never a dull moment with this story.

I had been waiting for Pepper Winers to continue Tess and Q\'s story and I devoured Quintessentially Q almost in one sitting. This is a highly addictive series and the writing is lush, detailed and very, very sexy. I mean, Q almost literally burns up the pages.

PLus, Alayna has her own demons to deal with which make her behaviour at times vert maddening! This book inspired a lot of emotion in me and I was really worried that she would be the one to drive the two of them apart: \n \"He\'d told me once that he would always be manioulative and domineering, even when he wasn\'t playing games. It was who he was. Me, I would always be obssessive. I\'d always question. Even when I was healthy.

But her obsessive nature bubbles to the surface on more than one occassion. \n Hudson also seems to be keeping something from Laynie despite their promises to be completely honest and open with each other. There is a very compelling storyline here that is very creative and emotional. At times, I feared that Hudson\'s behavior, not Laynie\'s, would destroy their relationship.

I\'m still obsessed with him. \n Last Light picks up as Matt has faked his own death, and retreated to a life of solitude in the woods. He simply cannot bear the attention and acclaim that came with being a famous author. He has convinced Hannah to play along with his ruse, much to her growing dismay. Poor, beleagured Hannah is forced into the charade as she attends Matt\'s memorial and is faced with lying to his family and an ever-growing web of deceit. And hello, Sky brothers! In Last Light, we get to know uber-sexy, bad-boy Seth, who I hope and pray will get his own story soon. Seth is absolutely irresistable. But I digress.

Becca is frantically searching for her missing brother, and her search leads her to Nicholas Bixey and Hard Ink, the tattoo parlor he co-owns with his brother. Nick resists her at first but then is drawn into helping her, due to the deep ties he had with her military father and because he is completely attracted to her. The action begins and doesn\'t let up until the last page. There are some loose ends left (NOT a cliffhanger though!) and I can\'t wait to see where the author takes us with the underlying mystery. \n One of the reasons why I loved this romantic suspense story is because the relationship between Becca and Nick builds nicely and is very believable. Yes, their chemistry is off the charts but they both treat each other with respect and Becca could have been a pushover but she\'s actually a very strong character. \n Hard As It Gets is a tough, sexy, action-filled mystery filled with well-written, fantastic characters.

This book is a must-read!! \n Professor Emerson and his wife do appear here, but Raven and the Prince are themselves insanely fascinating. Even if you are not a huge fan of paranormal stories, this book is a must read for the thrilling story and lush, intensely sexual scenes. We are introduced to the Prince, leader of the City of Florence, who is at once cold and calculating but beautiful in his own right. He cannot stay away from Raven and feels compelled to help her again and again. He sees in her virtue and goodness, and she awakens long-dormant feelings that he never believed he could have, even at his own peril. \n \"I\'m afraid that trouble is not what you do. Trouble is what you are.\" \n Raven is an unlikely heroine and I fell in love with her! She is damaged goods, inside and out, and her painful history is hinted at and then ultimately explained. She is an extremely sympathetic character and I cannot wait to read more about her in the next book.

I read a fair amount of m/m books and I generally find female authors to be a bit less gritty, but I will say the sex scenes in Saving Alexander did not disappoint! The heartbreaking description of Alex\'s background, from which he tries to find some sort of healing through BDSM sessions, is balanced out nicely by the loving relationship he finds with Sage. There is a suspenseful storyline here along with the very erotic romance between Sage and Alex. The only minor drawback for me was that these two talked A LOT about their relationship and their feelings. But overall I really liked this book and found it to be incredibly well written and enjoyable! Definitely a must-read for any fan of m/m books. \n *ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*'),

I love it when that much thought goes into a cover. Okay, now, onto the story. I read this fantastic book in one day! Jack and Keri Ann totally drew me in and would not let go. I absolutely loved the Southern beach town setting and the not-so-pretty glimpse into the world of Hollywood fame and superstardom. The author has created very passionate and complex characters that I related to from the first page. And the steam factor is perfect! Both characters have complicated histories that are slowly revealed, making for an emotional and at times, shocking read. Book Hangover factor was a 10 on this one. Loved this book and cannot wait for its sequel, Forever, Jack.'),

I picked up Jake Undone and was immediately drawn into the story, without knowing too much about the author or the characters. I recommend reading Gemini first but I don\'t think it\'s 100% necessary. Jake and Nina captivated me from the the first page. They begin in the friend zone as roommates but it\'s clear there is so much more to Jake than he is revealing to Nina. He is hot, tatted, passionate, and surprise, an engineer! Nina is beautiful but filled with phobias which Jake helps her overcome. \n These two have amazing chemistry, and the story is totally captivating! This book was a complete surprise. Jake and Nina\'s sexy times are absolutely incredible. The story has two major plot twists (yes, two!) which completely took me by surprise. The author has created a very memorable book boyfriend in Jake. And the dual POV\'s are perfect. I am so happy to have found Jake, Nina and author Penelope Ward and look forward to her next book!'),

Nicki works in the White House, traveling with the President and in a seemingly passionate relationship with Juan Carlos. Along comes Adam, now a BBC reporter who now has a long-term girlfriend. Nicki can\'t forget her first love Adam but a relationship between them now would violate lots of rules, both personal and professional. There is lots of back-and-forth between Adam and Nicki and although at times, I wanted their relationship to speed up a bit, it was actually very realistic. I was pleasantly surprised at the steam factor in this book! I loved it! Mary Whitney obviously did her research here on the politics of working in the White House. This is a very smart, sexy, adult book, and is a great conclusion to Adam and Nicki\'s story! \n (An ARC was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review)'),

Their sex scenes are totally hot and the story overall is very well-written and believable. I loved the Epilogue!

(427, 49, 96, 4, '3.5 stars!! Always You is a very hot, sweet and sometimes angsty story of a student-teacher romance. Wrenn is very mature for an 18 year old and Dalton is only a few years older, just out of college. Added to that is the fact that he is teaching at her school on a temporary assignment, filling in for a teacher on maternity leave. \n Their attraction builds, and their scenes together are very satisfying and super-steamy. This story is perfect for when you need a sexy, fairly quick read that is a standalone with no cliffhanger. I didn\'t feel too much of a taboo feeling towards their relationship, but I was on pins and needles waiting for the other shoe to drop. \n Dalton is hiding a life-changing secret that is hinted at from the beginning. I liked the sensitivity with which the author dealt with his topic, and the ending and prologue were nicely satisfying. Always You is another enjoyable, sexy and emotional read from Missy Johnson.'),
(428, 49, 54, 4, '4.5 stars! LOVE LOVE LOVED it!! \n Jace and Colt (love the name) have been admiring each other from afar for years. Jace is openly gay but Colt is closeted. This book literally hits the ground running, and doesn\'t let up until the end. I was hooked right away and loved every minute of this very beautiful, sexy and dramatic story. And let me tell you, this story is HOT!! \n When Colt and Jace first get together, there are almost fireworks exploding! \n \"Let me tell you what I am sure of, what I want. I want you to fuck me tonight. I want you inside me. It\'s my first time, but I know I liked your finger in my ass when we made out in the locker room. How do you feel about that?\" \n I loved Jace, he is kind and loving and only wants the best for Colt. He could have pushed Colt to come out of the closet but he didn\'t. He is loving and protective, even though he gets hurt by Colt\'s actions. These characters tragically spend years apart, and during that time, I also felt huge sympathy for Colt. Living his life as a lie brings him nothing but pain and heartache. But he courageously makes a lot of changes and as part of that, he goes after the love of his life, Jace. \n \"No, I just need a minute, that\'s all. I\'ve thought about this night for a long time. I want this, and I want it with you.\" Colt kissed Jace\'s lips, a smile spread across his face. \"I plan on doing this often. Just be gentle with me, or not. Whatever.\" And with that, Colt gave a devilish smirk, winked, and turned on his heel, not bothering to look back as he stepped inside the bathroom. \n I loved the beautiful love story between Jace and Colt. It gets a but melodramatic at times but the love scenes are fantastic and I loved the whole storyline about being openly gay in the world of professional sports. I love a sexy M/M story with two male leads who are devoted to each other. Beware, this book is also filled with some pretty hateful characters! There are also some great supporting players. In particular, I am hopeful that Mitch will get his own story! This is my first book by Kindle Alexander and I can\'t wait to read more from her. \n (ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.) \n Favorite Quotes: \n \"You\'re so freaking hot, Michaels. As much as I love watching you suck my thumb, I have bigger plans for you. I wanna show you how good this can be. I need to be buried balls deep inside you, and I will be, but I want you good and relaxed before we start.\" \n \"I\'m not gonna say it now, but I hope you see where I\'m going with this. I want the promise of someday from you. That\'s all I\'m asking, Jace.\" \n \"I love you, Jace. I always have, and through all my mistakes, I wanted you to know I\'ve never said that to anyone else.

There is a little bit of a Colleen Hoover and Jamie McGuire vibe about this book, but it is also very adult on many levels, despite the college setting. \n Amber, Brock and Ryder are all very complex characters and their histories makes it easy to understand and empathize with them as they plunge headlong into a steamy and passionate relationship. Amber especially has suffered terribly, but has pulled her life together (somewhat) by attending college in Maryland. \n \"... (T)heir safety net came too late, unable to save me from my ancient habits. I continue to disconnect, self-destructing one man at a time, using sex as a brain detox.

Starting at the age of fourteen, I\'ve abused, loved, craved, and hated sex in ways most people can\'t fathom. It\'d rock their skulls. I\'ve given it away without feeling a morsel of anything for the person on the receiving end and, many times, accepted it from those I knew couldn\'t stomach me.\" \n Amber is deeply attracted to both Brock and Ryder but Gail McHugh makes it very understandable how their feelings develop, even though Brock and Ryder are best friends: \n \"Despite my friendship with Brock, Amber\'s worth a few rounds in the moral boxing ring.\" \n The plot was unexpectedly thrilling, and there was a rawness to this book that I did not expect. The characters were also unexpectedly sympathetic. I had a few minor drawbacks with the story but overall, I felt that Amber to Ashes was a very fresh and surprisingly sexy story that left me wanting more from this author! \n \"Attraction. Lust.

In fact, she is engaged to a seemingly perfect guy. \n \"Trip Wilmington had been a gorgeous teenaged boy, no question.

Would Layla and Trip get a chance to correct their past actions? This is an absolutely amazing, witty and emotional book and I don\'t want to give away any of the spectacular plot here.

He is sweet, gorgeous, a little insecure and a little damaged. I absolutely devoured this nostalgic story about small-town life and loved all the swoon-worthy moments in this book. Trip is the new kid in school and Layla quickly befriends him. But she falls for him, and isn\'t sure of his feelings for her. The story takes place during senior year of high school so everyone is getting ready to go their own way, which adds to the overall poignant atmosphere of the story. \n Remember When is a rich, funny, witty and beautiful look back at the feelings of our first true love. It is fast paced and filled with memorable characters. The final chapters of this book might contain one of my favorite scenes ever in a book. I am still thinking about it.

He\'s kind and helpful underneath the rough exterior. He really wants to help Serenity sort her shit out. It doesn\'t \n hurt that that he is hot as hell and the sex is great. Knights\' Sinner is a great, quick read. \n Ellen: Once again, Bella delivers a super-hot, sexy story with characters you can sympathize with. I loved Serenity and the chemistry between Jackson and her is amazing. There are some super-steamy scenes between them, I loved Jackson because he is a little older and really knows what he wants. The age difference between Jackson and Serenity keeps things interesting. The story has just enough tension and drama to keep this a page-turner, there is some violence but the sex is HOT HOT HOT.

I loved Adam and Mia\'s near-constant fighting almost as much as I loved their incredibly hot sex scenes. These two can\'t stay away from each other even though they drive each other crazy when they\'re together. The book is told in a series of alternating POV\'s which I loved. Adam and Mia married young, and suffered through an incredibly painful tragedy. A series of unfortunate misunderstandings leads to their breaking up, but they never stopped loving each other. At times during the story, I found Mia\'s behavior to be absolutely infuriating but I really grew to love her about half-way through the book! And Adam is amazing! All he wants to do is provide a home for Mia. He is a really good guy but he always says the wrong thing. \n There is an exciting storyline and a very satisfying epilogue to Adam and Mia\'s story. Sometimes, you need a break from all the wealthy billionaire/innocent heroine love stories with a story about two very down-to-earth and relatable characters and this is the perfect antidote.

This book is filled with plenty of funny and witty moments to go along with the dramatic, emotional and very sexy scenes. The book is an emotional roller-coaster but the author wisely lightens up the drama with just enough light-hearted moments to make this one very enjoyable and read-in-one-sitting book. \n Cadence is a high school student who made one pretty bad mistake one night. She is sent to juvenile detention, and when she returns to high school, she is horribly bullied and becomes a total outcast. Her parents are in complete denial about her situation at school, adding to her desperation and loneliness. The only bright spot (well, two, more about that in a minute) is her smart, kind and oh-so-sexy teacher, Mark Connelly.

I loved Avery! And the teenage-girl banter between Cadence and Avery is hilarious, sad, dirty and sweet, all at the same time. \n Back to Mr. Connelly. I loved him. The forbidden aspect of their relationship only made it more thrilling (and poignant) for me. Adding to the age difference, Cadence comes from a strict Christian home and she constantly battles with what she has been taught. Is she a bad person? No. Is Mark a bad person? Absolutely not!

Shaun and Natalie start off as good friends and move towards a deeper relationship when they have the most mind-blowing sex of their lives. And Ms. Abel can write some SOMKING hot sex scenes!

While living her somewhat lonely life, she meets the gorgeous, sexy and wealthy Jay, which is where I thought, \"Uh oh, not this story line again.\" Well, I was dead wrong!

And, in this moment, I was willing to be whatever he wanted.\" \n Asia had her heart broken by her first love, Marcus, who is still in her life as her brother\'s best friend.

He\'d known the real me, and there had been something between us that I could never explain.\" \n I don\'t want to go into much detail about the plot because it is very creative and filled with a fabulous cast of supporting characters. Freeing Asia is a great story about finding yourself and finding your own self-worth. \n \"You should be proud of who you are babe, \'cause you are amazing.\" \n Don\'t worry, there\'s lots and lots of steam in this book! This is the kind of book that you start reading and don\'t put down until you\'re finished. I absolutely felt a deep connection to these characters, and must admit that it was tough to pick between Marcus and Jay!

To the rescue comes the hot Jake Andrews, who is actually a really, really great guy underneath all that baseball-playing hotness. And he\'s funny, too.

(445, 50, 69, 4, '4.5 stars!! Cage is a quick, sexy, hot, fast-paced, you-can\'t-put-it-down book in the Corps Security series. I absolutely loved this book and feel the author has really improved her writing style since the first book. \n Let\'s start with Greg Cage. Lord this man is HOT. He is super-protective, loyal and knows pretty much right away that Melissa is very different from any of the women he has been involved with (and there are plenty!) He is used to being pursued, not being the pursuer. \n \"My body wants her; that is no secret, but level of want is borderline craving. I need her. Needing someone is not something I am used to. No, I am used to being needed...something this woman clearly doesn\'t want.\" \n Cage and Melissa connect on a deeper level than just the hot sex but Melissa is a tough character. She is used to being the strong one in her family, and they rely on for everything. She is very wary of men and relationships. Will she let her guard down and let Cage in? I wanted her to open her heart to Cage and trust him completely from the very beginning, but she is too wary. \n \"No, even with the perfect sex, I have learned enough from my sister to know it isn\'t wise to let a man have your heart. When that happens, it is only a matter of time before you lose yourself.\" \n There are a lot of twists to the story and one very large secret that threatens to tear Cage and Melissa apart. These two are so amazing together, that I was on the edge of my seat until the very end. Cage knows Melissa is his \"missing piece\", and I absolutely loved the way the author concludes this story. I hope we get more of these two characters in future books. \n I also loved the cast of supporting characters in this series, and cannot wait for Beck and Dee\'s story. Corps Security is a favorite series! Love all these guys, and can\'t wait to read more.'),
(446, 50, 9, 4, '4.5 stars!! I will admit I was drawn to this book by its gorgeous cover and what was inside did not disappoint! I loved this book. It is a story about real, working-class people with real problems and real passions. And the sex is OFF THE CHARTS! Kayden has a great job and a seemingly stable life, but has had anger issues and a psycho ex-girlfriend who made his life hell. He and Sophia connect through Facebook one day, and they begin to communicate and can\'t resist wanting to get to know each other better. He was a friend of her older brother and is very sexy and has an allure that Sophia can\'t resist. She leads a quiet life, and is looking for a little excitement and yes, even love. \n Sophia is willing to take a risk on the handsome Kayden, and falls quickly for him. He really is a decent guy, but his internal demons threaten their relationship. I loved seeing these characters really develop and grow throughout this book, and the story kept me turning the pages until the end. I really was invested in these characters\' stories and felt a connection with them from the very beginning. \n Untangle Me is a great debut from this author. The characters have ordinary lives (no billionaires here!) but the sex scenes are scorching and their problems are real. The ending got a little dramatic but overall this was a very enjoyable read for me, and I recommend it for anyone who wants a hot, well-written and gripping story. \n I also loved the New Orleans and Florida settings! The author really got it right on both accounts. I\'m looking to more books from this author in the future. \n ** ARC provided by author for an honest review **'),
(447, 50, 1, 4, '4 1/2 stars! I loved this book! It is so refreshing to read a modern, funny and very sexy story that still has some emotional weight to it. Andie is a hard-working lawyer, stuck on a personal and professional path that might not be right for her. It takes an impulsive trip to Vegas with friends to change everything. She meets gorgeous cowboy Mack, outrageous flirting ensues, and they have a smoking-hot one night stand. Mack is actually refreshingly open and honest about his feelings almost right from the start, which I really enjoyed about him: \n \"It means if I want to get lucky with you, I should take the risk and tell you what\'s on my mind, because failing would be worse than never trying.\" \n Andie has her life mapped out in detail and refuses to budge, even when life throws her a few surprises. She has a tough time believing that a guy like Mack could be interested in her. \n \"He sounded so sincere, it made my heart skip a beat. How could a guy that good in bed and this gorgeous be so nice?\" \n Andie must be in control of every detail of her life at all times. I love how she evolves and grows as a character during Shine Not Burn and allows real life to change her rigid plans. There\'s lots of humor and some very hot sex in this book and I loved every minute. And, since I\'m picky about this, kudos to Elle Casey for getting lots of legal details very accurate. \n No spoilers but I absolutely loved the way the story concluded and I am really looking forward to more books like Shine Not Burn from Elle Casey!'),

Sex and scissors should never mix. \n Poor Gavin! He is in love with Charlotte, with whom he grew up and who unfortunately has \"friend-zoned\" him. Or so he thinks. Love and Lists is the hilarious story of two twenty-somethings (and their group of friends) who constantly think about sex and how to have it. \n If you\'ve read any of Tara Sivec\'s hysterically funny Chocolate Lovers books, you know she is really foul-mouthed and really funny. Love and Lists is no different and it is a very cute and refreshing story. I loved the main characters, Gavin and Charlotte, and the supporting cast. This book also has a surprising change of course about mid-way through the story which I loved. Will Gavin get the girl? Will he move out of the \"friend zone\"? Everything is answered in a very satisfying and funny way by the author. If you want a dirty, funny and fairly quick read, don\'t miss Love and Lists! \n (ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review)'),

I had a very long and stressful week when I looked at my reading calendar and saw Stinger up on deck. So I jumped right in. \n I was hooked from the first page. Mia Sheridan has written a finely developed, emotionally charged and sexylicious book that I devoured very quickly. Grace and Stinger literally run right into each other in Vegas while both are attending very different conferences: she, a law conference, he, a porn convention. Yes, he is an adult film star. Grace is a straight-laced law student, hell-bent on following a certain career and life path and she absolutely, positively will not be pushed away from following her life plan! \n So meeting a porn star doesn\'t exactly fit in with her well-made plans. \n I could fill this review with breathtaking quotes from Stinger but I would love it if you would give this story a chance and read it with fresh eyes. The author has created a gorgeous, sexy but very smart and sensitive hero in Stinger, and a beautiful, smart and kind heroine in Grace. Neither is perfect, yet neither one is afraid to admit when they have made a mistake. There are also lots of essential supporting characters here, some living, some gone, who populate this book and make it come alive. \n The characters also undergo tremendous emotional growth in Stinger, an essential development which is very often missing in a lot of books. For the storyline, the amazing sexy times, and the fabulous characters, I am giving Stinger five stars!'),

Note: although this book can be read as a standalone, I cannot recommend Bully and Until You highly enough. These books might not be everyone\'s cup of tea, but the sexual tension, the constant push-and-pull between the characters, the engaging and thoughtful story lines are among my very favorite books. \n I have two words: JAX TRENT. Oh my lord. This book was well worth the wait just to get inside that sexy, beautiful head of his. \n And K.C.? I absolutely adored reading about her history, her back story, and her motivations. This whole book was one delicious treat just begging to be unwrapped. There are a lot of hot sexy times in this book, the writing to me is flawless and yes, there is a whopper of a teaser for AFLAME at the end!!

Bully is one of my favorite books ever and Until You has now taken its place as one of my all-time favorites. Jared got under my skin and would not let go! Ms. Douglas is an incredibly skilled writer and gifted storyteller who has created some of the most memorable characters I have ever read. \n If you have not read Bully, I urge you to do so. The story has twists and surprises and beautifully-written characters. And the author has continued Jared and Tate\'s journey in Until You, \n I absolutely devoured this book and loved getting inside Jared\'s head. And the pain he endured during his life, well, let\'s just say that I felt so much emotion for him I thought my heart would burst. There is also plenty of steam in Until You and I loved the intense chemistry between Tate and Jared. \n Until You is another amazing book from Ms. Douglas.

(452, 50, 13, 4, '4.5 loved-every-tortured-minute stars!! \n I am a huge fan of Penelope Douglas and her books are perfection to me. I was absolutely enthralled by Madoc and Fallon, I had always LOVED Madoc and was thrilled he was getting his own story. In Rival, the author deals with lots of emotion, heavy subjects and the pain of tragedy but she always throws in a little humor to lighten things up a bit. Madoc and Fallon have a forbidden love but the way the author tells their story, you fell nothing but empathy and love for them. \n I absolutely love these characters, and how the author never disappoints with the steam and chemistry factor. Her writing is honest, elegant and blunt, and never filters out the harsh reality of life with hearts-and-butterflies. Madoc and Fallon have had some terrible things happen in their lives but they still turn out to be honest and good young adults. This series is one of my favorites and I highly recommend that you start with Bully, which is one of my all-time favorite books. \n Tate and Jared do get an appearance here, as well as Jax, who is getting his own book soon (yay!). But Madoc and Fallon are the focus and they are fantastic characters. I love Madoc\'s hot, tough-guy exterior and Fallon\'s off-beat personality. Of course, they are are hiding their pain and they must work through lots of miscommunication before we get to their very satisfying conclusion. \n I absolutely loved this book and can\'t wait for Jax\'s story! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(453, 50, 15, 4, '4.5 stars!! \n One More Chance is an incredibly romantic and emotional story which is exactly what I have come to expect from Abbi Glines. I loved Grant in Take a Chance and was curious to see where the author would take her characters on the next step in their story. If you read Take a Chance, you know that Harlow has a secret that could have led to the end of her beautiful relationship with Grant. But in true Abbi Glines fashion, she takes the reader on an incredible journey through all the emotions as she gives Grant and Harlow an incredible HEA. \n I am a huge Abbi Glines fan and each story is a little different. One More Chance is not a fun, light, beach read but instead a very romantic (for me), loving story that I devoured quickly. If you love the Rosemary Beach characters, then this is a must-read. Grant is unwavering in his devotion to Harlow and she is a loving, kind and beautiful character. One of my favorite female heroines from Abbi Glines. \n There are a few surprises here and I don\'t want to get too detailed. Just enjoy this yummy book and all of the characters you have come to love from Abbi Glines\' Rosemary Beach series. \n (*ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)'),
(454, 51, 100, 5, 'WOW!!! When I finished reading this book, I honestly did not know what genre to put this book in! And I was afraid to give anything away on Goodreads. I literally had to email the author to ask her explicitly which category she thought this story should be in. It is NOT dark/taboo/forbidden. What it most defitnitely is: sweeping, grand, thrilling, exciting, heartbreaking, joyous and life-affirming. . . and unlike ANYTHING you\'ve ever read from Pepper Winters. Enjoy the ride! \n (The author has now revealed the inspiration behind the story and the full blurb on her website, check it out!!) \n \"Love doesn\'t live in first glances. Life doesn\'t dwell in second chances. Our path exists in unseen messages.\" \n Yes, this is a long book, but trust me when I say that I flew through the pages. The story revolves around Estelle Evermore, who is a rising singer and songwriter but who is desperate to fly back home after being on a grueling tour. There are ominous signs everywhere warning her not to get on the plane. The sense of foreboding is almost suffocating! Also on her flight is Galloway Oak, and although these two are strangers, in a very short time they will become dependent on each other for their very lives. \n Pepper Winters is one of my favorite dark romance authors. To say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book is an understatement. While there is dark sense of foreboding, Unseen Messages is in no way dark at all. It is a finely detailed, epic romance with thrilling elements and stunning settings. When the characters were exhausted, sunburned and starving, I felt their pain. When they suffer unimaginable loss, I felt their heartache. I connected with the characters and became immersed in their story of survival. \n If you are looking for something very different to read, try Unseen Messages. The ending was surprising and beautiful and uplifting. I applaud the author for stepping outside her comfort zone and giving us Estelle and Galloway. They are two memorable characters that will stay with me for a long time. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),
(455, 51, 10, 5, 'Wow. This story will follow you long after you finish reading. I absolutely love dark and angsty books (hello, Captive in the Dark and Comfort Food) so the story line was perfect. The author takes you on an emotional roller coaster with this book and does not let up until the very last word. Tess is a strong and willful character and never once gives in to her situation. Her \"master\" Q is just amazing, yes, I said it, dark, sexy, irresistible...but there\'s much more to the man and his background then meets the eye. There\'s lots of very explicit sex, violence, slavery themes, BDSM and disturbing images in Tears of Tess but there\'s also beauty, redemption, exotic locales and incredibly well-written characters. I cannot wait for the next book from this author, which will be about Q. This book is one of my top reads of 2013. Don\'t miss it. \n (ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.)'),

I highly recommend the series, they are some of the most thrilling, touching, sexy and gritty books you will ever read. Dirty Angels is a standalone novel and you absolutely can dive in without reading any of the other books, but just make sure you pick them up at some point! \n Dirty Angels is without question very, very violent; very, very dirty and sexy. It is another WILD ride from Karina Halle!! The story takes place among Mexican drug cartel members in Mexico but at its heart, it is a tender (well, kind of) and beautiful love story. Javier commits unspeakable acts but he is also a human being and becomes obsessed with Luisa, after he kidnaps her and holds her for ransom, The problem is that Luisa has gone from one violent and dysfunctional man to another. She is incredibly resilient and strong but finds herself drawn to the very alluring Javier. \n I found the sex scenes to be incredibly alluring and the alternating POV\'s worked perfectly here. I highly recommend this book if you want to read a story that is not all rainbows and unicorns but is instead filled with gritty characters, painful choices, incredibly satisfying love scenes and some wild, violent action. Another fantastic story from Karina Halle. #TeamJavier all the way, baby. \n (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)'),

The last half of Panic is very fast-paced and almost morphed into a thriller which was fine by me. I absolutely love all the characters in these stories (even the ones I love to hate) but I really love Ford. \n Rook turns into a very, strong heroine and you can see how resilient she really is. But she is far from perfect which is one of the things I liked about this story. I liked how she interacted with Ford and in particular there is a scene between her and Ford that could have taken a predicatble turn but didn\'t. \n I love a dual POV book and the author does not dissapoint with giving us both Rook\'s and Ronin\'s POV. There are also plenty of steamy scenes in this book. Overall a very satisfying conclusion to Rook and Ronin\'s story. And more Ford please!'),

Which is not to say he hasn\'t had some experience. \n \"Damn it, Bennett,\" I panted. \"How in the hell do you know how exactly to drive me insane?\" \n \"I said I was a virgin, Avery. Not a saint.\" \n \"Or even a monk, apparently,\" I mumbled. I felt him smile against my skin. \n The main character, Avery, keeps giving away pieces of herself by hooking up with other guys but she keeps her real feelings locked away. With Bennett\'s help, she finds the strength to confront the demons in her past, and confront the past demons which keep her from forming a loving relationship. I liked how strong her character was. I also liked Avery\'s relationship with her best friends, which was funny and realistic. \n The best part of All of You was without a doubt Bennett! I loved that he was both sexy and romantic, artistic and extremely honest. No game-playing here. I loved the dialogue between Bennett and Avery and yes, they had tons of chemistry together. All in all, Christina Lee\'s debut novel is a very refreshing and yet very sexy read. I am looking to more from her in the future!'),

Ms. Darhower is an extremely gifted writer and she has crafted memorable characters that will stay with you long after you finish this story. \n Sempre opened with one of the most heartbreaking and harrowing scenes I have ever read. Carmine and Haven are two of my favorite fictional characters and I had been waiting anxiously for their story to continue. Sempre: Redemption is very much a gripping crime story, but really delivers on the emotion and romance.

Conflicted Love is the story of Teeny and Trip, who we first met in Tattered Love. I highly recommend reading Book #1 first to get a feel for the background story of these characters, and also because it\'s a surprisingly engaging and sexy story. Teeny is a tough character, very independent, and finds herself in an unexpected situation after a hot night with the very sexy tatted and pierced Trip. She really doesn\'t want to fall for Trip but he does some pretty amazing things to prove himself a worthy partner. He has never been in a lasting relationship but to his credit, really fights his way into Teeny\'s life. Lots of really hot sex ensues, along with some very funny moments due to her pregnancy.

Exploring themes of friendship, loyalty, love, survival and acceptance, Leah Raeder writes in a way that will haunt you and make you question the very nature of right and wrong. Maise is not your typical heroine, and her story is both heartbreaking and triumphant at the same time. And the sex scenes are completely off the charts. Leah Raeder is incredibly gifted and it\'s hard to believe this is her debut book. Absolutely breathtaking book. Layered, nuanced, tragic, funny, and ultimately, hopeful.

Her relationship with her parents is heartbreaking and the blooming of Soren, Nora and Kingsley\'s inevitable and lifelong bond is a beautiful and very sexy thing to watch unfold. I could not put this book down and felt like I was spending time with some old (if not very dangerous) friends. I loved the switching back and forth between past and present as an adult Nora tells the story to her current lover (no spoilers as to his identity!)

I am equally fascinated by pen names, and even when the writer professes to be one gender or the other (or leaves it open to the imagination such as BG Harlen), I still wonder at the back of my mind whether the author is a male or female. Do some female writers have a decidedly masculine POV? Yes, there are several that come to mind. Do some male writers have a feminine \"flavor\" to their writing? It seems so. \n And so we come to the fascinating Thou Shalt Not. I loved Luke\'s story, as well as JJ Rossum\'s writing style, and don\'t want to be pigeon-holed into thinking that the author is male or female. That\'s just me. Either way, it\'s a very sexy and engaging book with plenty of steamy scenes to satisfy even the most jaded erotic romance reader (such as myself). The story carries some very weighty themes (domestic violence, adultery, the nature of beauty), but the book is very fast-paced and satisfying. Will Luke keep himself out of trouble with April? Will he learn to really love someone again? No spoilers here, but the author answers these questions while exploring what qualities are really important and what makes someone worthy of love. \n This book has a very interesting conclusion that some readers will love, and some might find a little challenging.

This book has everything that I love: graphic sex, strong characters, a thrilling storyline, and very dark and gritty elements. This book will stay with you long after you finish. I can\'t recommend it highly enough.'),
(473, 53, 99, 4, '*ARC received in return for an honest review \n Wow,what a wild ride. As a huge fan of the Edge of Never, I picked up this book without knowing anything about the story, I only knew that Andrew and Camryn would be making a cameo appearance. \n Bray and Elias met as children and grew up best friends, Bray was pretty much ignored by her family and suffered from benign neglect. She seemed like the wild child but really she was afraid to form bonds or attachments to people because she didn\'t understand that the other people could actually care for her. \n Elias was in love and devoted to Bray no matter what. This New Adult book contained some pretty spicy sex scenes but I felt they fit in with the story of the young characters as they grew and explored the world and their relationships. \n A shocking event occurs and Bray and Elias find themselves on the road. Many adventures ensue, and they meet up with another group young wanderers. I never thought there would be a HEA to this story based on their almost daily physical struggles and Bray\'s battle with bipolar disorder. depression. Elias would never leave a Bray no matter what, so it was difficult to see how there would be a satisfying conclusion to this book, but there was. \n I read several very negative reviews of this book and I don\'t agree at all. This book has enough drama, emotion and sexy times to satisfy any fan of New Adult books. Even though the ending seemed bleak at one point, I was very happy to see Bray and Elias get the ending they so deserved.'),

With that said, this is the story of misunderstandings, missed opportunities and a second chance at love.

Izzy goes on to marry Brandon, who she thought was a wonderful guy, but it turned out she was entering into a horrible, abusive marriage. \n \"People say karma is a bitch but I have news for you, karma doesn\'t have anything on fate when she is after blood.

We love Izzy, who was a fighter through all of the very rough events in her life. We love Axel, who still wants to protect Izzy, even though he too thought she had abandoned him years before. This book is filled with hot guys, rough talk and explicit sex. What\'s not to love? \n \"Never letting you go, Izzy. Never.\" He whispers into my hair, squeezing me a little tighter. \n \"I always have been yours, you know that, don\'t you?\" \n This is a super-hot, fast-paced read filled with Alpha males and a second-chance love story.

Hudson, our HOT Alpha also has some interesting secrets in his past, too. This book is pure reading pleasure: well-written characters, amazingly hot sex scenes, a connection between the main characters and a creative storyline.

I loved the San Francisco setting, and the secondary characters were well-thought-out also. I felt that Claire could have stopped doubting her relationship with Jonathan a little earlier on; I mean, here was a smart, successful businessman who clearly had real feelings for her and wasn\'t bothered at all by their age difference. Claire\'s continued insecurities were the only sticking point for me. The ending more than made up for that, and anyone who loves a HEA will love this book!

Of course, all of this changes in a heartbeat when she meets MMA fighter Nico Hunter, and she knows her life will never be the same. \n I\'ve never seen a body like his so close before. It just doesn\'t seem real. Both of his arms are covered in tattoos, it looks like he\'s wearing colorful sleeves, only he has no shirt on. They intertwine and wrap around his bulging biceps and I get the urge to trace a path from the first splat of ink to the last with my tongue. My body\'s reaction to him is unlike anything I\'ve ever felt before. These aren\'t feelings that I\'m used to, they seem to come out of nowhere and are uncontrollable. \n There are very painful reasons why Elle keeps her life relatively everything drama-free, and Nico, too, has had a traumatic event in his life which is revealed very early on in the book. Luckily for Elle, Nico knows what he wants and goes after it and wow! Nico is one HOT Alpha male, a really gorgeous, sexy and actually NICE guy who tries to break down the walls around Elle\'s heart and emotions. \n I know I could have taken it further after that kiss.

Cali devotes her time and energy to torturing Logan, planning one elaborate prank after another. Why does she hate Logan so much? The author keeps us guessing, only revealing that once upon a time, Logan was the best friend of Cali\'s brother, Ben. The story kept me turning the pages to find out why Logan allowed Cali to hate him so much, and what actually happened to Ben: \n \"Our rivalry is beautiful, because it makes us both forget about everything else.\" \n It turns out that Cali and Logan actually have a lot more in common than Cali thought at first. They both love poetry, which plays a very important role in \'Two Roads.\' As much as Cali\'s hateful behavior frustrated me at times, I absolutely loved Logan! He is a gorgeous nerd, who allows Cali to vent her emotions and hatred towards him, and just does not back down. \n Logan sees the \"real\" Cali underneath her hateful and mean treatment of him, and tries to help her let go of her anger, and tries to shows her that her life can have meaning.

The alternating POV\'s work perfectly here and kept me turning the pages late into the night. \n Raine Miller writes THE most amazing sex scenes, without being cliche or overdone. Of course her characters have a deep connection after all they have been through together, but it is still vital that I feel emotionally connected, too, and I absolutely felt connected to Ethan and Brynne. Ethan is still battling his inner demons, and Brynne must still contend with characters from her painful past. Nothing in the story is rushed, nothing is as expected, and all is brought to an incredibly satisfying conclusion in Rare and Precious Things.

If you have read the first two books in the Fading series (which I highly recommend), then you know that these books tackle some very tough issues including rape and its aftermath. Falling is beautifully and emotionally written and even includes a healthy dose of romance and steamy scenes. Ryan\'s personality has been shaped by extreme violence in his past, and we get some insight into the initially cold-hearted SOB that he was before he met Candace. Parts of this book are very difficult to read but the main characters all grow and change and find some measure of peace by the conclusion of the story.

(Since there is a surprise at the end of Arouse, I absolutely recommend that you read Arouse first.) Once again, the author uses a dual POV that switches seamlessly between Olivia and Dean. And once again, Ms. Lane knocks it out of the park with the sex scenes! Just when you think you have read it all before, along comes a book like Allure to show you just how stunningly beautiful erotica can be. \n Allure reveals more about the development of Dean and Liv\'s relationship, told in flashbacks woven into the current story. He was very careful with her in the beginning and always treated her as a treasure. \n \"Be with me, Liv,\" he said. \"Just be with me.\" \n Liv fell hard for the professor, despite the barriers she had erected to protect herself: \n \"I was crazy about him.

The author has crafted a heart-wrenching tale of pain, survival and love that will leave you wanting much more of Evie and Hunter\'s story. \n Can love come from pain? This is the theme of Wanderlust. Our heroine Evie is running away from a painful past and searching for emotional and physical freedom while on a trek across the U.S. to see Niagra Falls. Hunter is a trucker and let\'s just say they have a fateful encounter while on the open road. Is Hunter a monster? I don\'t think so, and in fact, I LOVED his character.

The characters of \"Sabian\" and Jocelyn are well-developed, there is plot and tension, and there are totally thrilling and HOT sex scenes. This was a completely surprising and fantastic book for me. I could not put it down. My heart broke a little during this book because of the predicament of the two main characters. And because Sabian is a male prostitute, well, you can imagine how freaking steamy the sex scenes are! Don\'t have time to put my favorite quotes here, I have to go read more books by Lauren Gallagher and L.A. Witt! \n READ this book!'),

I could not get enough of Gabriel and Julianne and re-read both Gabriel\'s Inferno and Gabriel\'s Rapture several times when they were first released. \n Gabriel\'s Redemption, the third book in the series, is immensely satisfying and stunningly written. Even descriptions of simple acts such as eating or studying take on rich and layered meanings when written by Sylvain Reynard. And the love scenes between Gabriel and his beloved Julia took my breath away. \n \"In the months since their marriage, their desire had not abated, nor had the sweetness of their coupling. All speech melted into motion and touch and the bliss of physical love.\" \n This story takes place shortly after their marriage and shows the struggles that Gabriel and Julia -- like most couples -- must go through while building a life together. Will Gabriel overcome the guilt he feels about his past? Will Julia be able to reconcile Gabriel\'s burning desire to start a family with her own educational ambitions? She, too, feels guilt and conflicting emotions over Gabriel\'s plans for their future together. \n \"Gabriel was a consuming fire. His passion, his desires, all seemed to overtake the desires of those around him. He\'d told her once that she was the only woman who\'d ever said no to him. He was probably correct.\" \n Sylvain Reynard weaves in many Old Testament references which enrich the love story between Gabriel and Julia. Nicely balanced with the heavy themes of love, forgiveness and redemption are the funny comments by the Snarky Narrator, which lend an air of levity to the book. \n The secondary characters that I love also make appearances in this book. Professor Picton is a strong influence on Julia and helps to guide her in making certain life-altering decisions including dealing with the evil Christa, who is still out to make trouble for the Emersons. We also see a glimpse into Paul Norris\' life and the dangerous Simon and Natalie also make appearances. \n Gabriel\'s devotion to Julia remains unwavering and I loved reading their scenes together. He still battles with feelings of inadequacy but Julia\'s goodness helps him overcome his deep-seated feelings of guilt and self-loathing. \n \"Almost six months into their marriage he loved her more than before, he envied the very air she breathed.\" \n I also loved the way in which Julia grew as a person in this book, and became much stronger in her educational studies and in dealing with her professors and others who conspire against her. She also stands up to Gabriel, who is certainly a force to be reckoned with. Gabriel, too, grows as a person as he uncovers facts about his past that help him find closure to certain events in his life and bring him some measure of peace. \n \"I suppose we\'re all on our own spiritual journeys.\" \n \"Some of us are further along than others.\" \n Sylvain Reynard did a spectacular job of concluding Julia and Gabriel\'s story in this book. Once again, Sylvain delivers a richly detailed and deeply-felt story that will stay with you long after you finish the last word. I was sobbing at the sheer beauty of this book and can\'t wait to read more from Sylvain Reynard. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.) \n And here is my one and only Professor Gabriel O.

But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for - Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business.

(537, 59, 31, 5, 'SYNOPSIS \n Hanna Boudreaux has lived in the small town of Willow all her life. She\'s sweet, cute and quiet. \n Hanna has a moment of epiphany when she realizes her crush for forever, Raiden Ulysses Miller, is not ever going to be hers. She sees her life as narrow and decides to do something about it. \n Raiden Miller is the town\'s local hero. A former Marine with the medal to prove his hero status, he comes home, shrouded in mystery. It takes a while, but eventually Hanna catches his eye. \n After all these years of Raid and Hanna living in the same town, the question is why? Is Raid interested in Hanna because she\'s sweet and cute? Or does Raid have something else going on? \n OUR REVIEW \n We have had a love affair with all things Kristen Ashley since we first read Knight last year. Yes, Knight was our first foray into Kit\'s world, and we have never looked back. We have read almost every single one of Ms. Ashley\'s books. Each of her series are highly recommended. Our blog is new so we have not posted all of our reviews yet but we can discuss each character at length, and yes, we have read every Rock Chick book. You can imagine our excitement when we were selected to receive an ARC of RAID. We could not believe it! \n Who can resist a book that even had us highlighting the Author\'s Note? \n \"I have many heart\'s desires and one of them is the slim chance that my books will guide women to accepting themselves as they are, having confidence in their bodies, brains and beauty and letting all that poison go so they can enjoy their lives, including sexually. \n ROCK ON, KRISTEN! \n We would like to think that there is a litte bit of Ms. Ashley in the character of Hanna. She is sweet, she is cute, she is trusting, she has a cat, she hand-knits afghans for a living and she lives in a small town. She has been crushing on Raiden Miller since she was a young girl. When he returns to town a war hero, and he finally notices her, her whole world is turned upside down. Of course, this would not be a proper Unfinished Hero book without a lot of danger, a lot of graphic sex and one HOT ALPHA MALE. You get all that and more with RAID. We confess that we re-read KNIGHT and CREED in one day while in the middle of reading RAID. \n Favorite Quotes: \n \"Prefer to be with a woman who\'s cute and shy and obviously into me. Means I can save time and get straight to shit that matters.\" - Raid \n \"I\'d crawled across a room for Raiden Miller. And it was him, not me, who stopped it because I didn\'t like it. Which made me look back and like it.\" - Hanna \n Hanna is Raid\'s reward. \n We loved this book and would have loved a little more interaction with the other unfinished heroes who appear in this story (this is a stand-alone book but you should read KNIGHT and CREED in that order). With that said, where can we find us a Raiden Ulysses Miller? \n RaidKristen Ashley'),

You do not need to have read Beautiful Disaster first, but I highly recommend that you do, in order to understand some of the nuances of the story and the characters. \n Travis is loving, he is sexy, he is kind, he is sensitive and he is very, very caring.

He is aware of his bad-boy reputation, but in his mind, he has always been nothing but totally honest with every girl he has ever been with: \n \"She was my opposite: innocent on the surface, and damaged deep within.\" \n I was a little frustrated at Abby\'s stubbornness in constantly pushing Travis away, emotionally and physically, but smart and sexy-ass Travis takes his mother\'s advice and fights hard for Abby! \n \"I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed.

Yes, I met the author, she was absolutely lovely but I did not fangirl over her because I had not yet read this treasure of a book!!! And now she seems to have disappeared!! GAAHHHHHH!! I need a do-0ver!! \n If you are like me, you probably have tons of books sitting on your e-reader (and maybe even on your bookshelf) unread for whatever reason. I made a resolution that this year, I would slow down on taking ARC\'s and get through all of the wonderful books that I have been meaning to get to for years. Well, TSoT is now one of my all-time favorite books. I can\'t stop thinking about it. The author has a special gift with the written word and I just want to shout from the rooftops about this treasure! \n \"My name is Nastya Kashnikov. I was a piano-playing prodigy who doesn\'t belong anywhere near an Intro to Music class. I was murdered two and a half years ago. Discuss.\" \n Nastya is starting high school at a new school, where she looks and feels and acts like the outsider that she is. She pushes everyone away with her special brand of toughness AND she also refuses to speak. At all. What happened to this girl that has made her so withdrawn from her family and everyone around her? \n \"I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck.\" \n Besides getting the feel and all the angst of high school EXACTLY right, the author slowly reveals what has made Nastya into the girl she is today. But if Nastya thinks she has the self-pity market cornered, she\'s got nothing on Josh Bennett, another loner who has had the most terrible tragedies happen to him. Josh is also unapproachable but he becomes fascinated by this girl who wears all-black every single day and acts angry all the time. \n \"She does look like a badass. I\'ve seen her arms, and she\'s ripped, which is kind of weird and scary all at once because it just seems all wrong on her. She\'s really small and fragile-looking, and at the same time, it\'s like she\'s some exotic teenage mercenary, all rock solid, dressed in black, ready to take somebody down. None of it makes any sense. It\'s kind of disconcerting. She\'s like an optical illusion. You look at it from one angle and you see the picture and you think you\'ve got a lock on it and then it shifts and the image changes to something entirely different and you can\'t even find the original picture anymore. It\'s a serious mindfuck.\" \n Nastya is an enigma. Her story gradually begins to unfold and it is extremely unsettling and almost unbearable. For all of her toughness, she is extremely fragile and vulnerable but eventually begins to let others in. Just a little. \n \"I haven\'t said a word to another living person in 452 days. I write my three and a half pages, tuck away my composition book, and crawl into bed, knowing how close I came to not making it to 453.\" \n Let me just say two words about this book: Josh Bennett. He is sensitive, intelligent and loyal. He realizes how fragile Nastya is. I adore him! He doesn\'t know why she is so closed off to the world but he very carefully begins to crack her shell, little by little. \n \"But the more she gives me, the more abstract she gets. It\'s like pieces to three different puzzles. You try to put them together but they never fit, and when you force them, the picture comes out all wrong. \n Despite her resolution never to let someone love her, Nastya begins to get close to Josh and his very small circle of old friends. Their relationship unfolds very slowly but they just seem to understand each other. She still keeps secrets from him but she begins to trust him absolutely. \n \"Josh Bennett laughs, and for one minute, everything is right in the world.\" \n Josh is Nastya\'s lifeline. As her carefully constructed world begins to fall apart, Josh is there for her. Until she pushes him away. I honestly did not know whether or not the author was going to give these two the happy ending they both so desperately deserved, but the ending was PERFECT. I almost stopped breathing during the last 15% of this book. Nastya is so pessimistic about her future that nothing about this book would have surprised me. \n \"People like Josh Bennett and I don\'t get perfect. Most of the time, we don\'t even get remotely tolerable. And that\'s why it scares me. Because, even if there was such a thing to begin with, perfect never lasts.\" \n This book actually has some light moments and very funny scenes mixed in with all the angst. They were a welcome relief from the heaviness and were done just right. All of the supporting characters were absolutely perfect and I pray for another book soon from Katya Millay. If you haven\'t read this book yet, don\'t wait. It is truly a treasure. \n \"Every day you save me.\"'),

(571, 62, 16, 5, '\"Break Her\" is one of those books that I am really not qualified to \"review\" because the writing is so amazing (Clue #1 as to the author\'s identity!) so I\'ll just stick to giving my humble opinion. \n I read this book a few months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. To me, that is the hallmark of an excellent book. Here is the synopsis of the story, in which a woman wakes to find a dangerous stranger in her bed: \n \"Now your home has become your prison, and your body, a battlefield. How would you hold onto your sanity, your self-esteem, your very soul against someone determined to annihilate all three? \n In the psychological thriller Break Her, one woman will find herself in this almost unthinkable situation, and one man will discover that he has finally come up against someone unlike any of those he has destroyed before. \n On the surface, this intruder has all the advantages: strength, weapons, ruthlessness. The only way he can lose is if he finds himself responding to his victim on a human level. The only way she can win is if she rips away the protective lies she\'s told herself, the hard shell of indifference she\'s hidden in, and becomes again what she has not been since she lost everything that mattered to her, years ago. \" \n Break Her is a very graphic story of the gripping psychological interplay between the woman and the rapist. (I refuse to call her simply \"Victim\" as some reviewers have done.) The rapist is very cunning and very strong. He is determined to destroy the woman not only physically, but emotionally as well. \n \"He was decent looking. He probably had money. He could have sex any way he wanted any time he wanted. But he liked it this way.\" \n The story itself is set over a period of an excruciating day and a half, within the physical confines of a house. The characters are not named by the author. Through a series of flashbacks, however, the woman\'s past is explained in detail and other characters are introduced. I was hanging on every word, and reading furiously to reach the stunning conclusion of this book. \n \"You think you\'ll wear me out,\" he hissed, not using a question. \"You think you\'ll eventually satisfy me, and reach the end of this. But everything you do makes me want you more, deeper, impossibly more. I think I\'m reaching a point I\'ve never hit before. Like perpetual motion. Or nirvana. I\'ll never stop.\" \n There are many questions raised by this story. What was the author trying to convey here? Well, first and foremost, I think it is a story of the woman\'s fierce strength and will to survive. The author has written this book under a pseudonym so that we do not know the writer\'s gender. Brilliant. \n The author has ventured an opinion on the subject of rape in other forums that forgiveness allows rape victims to move on, and to separate themselves from what happened. The author has also questioned why rape is the only crime that seems to be an \"open wound\", which gives men a huge amount of power to know that by this one act, they can potentially destroy a woman. Certainly the woman in \"Break Her\" does not accept the definition of rape as an \"open wound\" and in that sense, this book is very empowering. \n \"Break Her\" is an incredibly gripping and yes, emotionally exhausting, story. It is very thought-provoking and will make you question what values you believe in. I could not put this book down. I can only hope that the author chooses to continue the woman\'s story because I need more of this story.Break HerB.G. Harlen'),

WOW ... there are no words to describe how this book made me feel. The tragic story of Roan \"Fox\" was simply the most heartbreaking thing ever. So when reading this book, make sure to prepare your hear, grab a box of tissues and be prepared to cry your eyes out. \n \"The moment I set eyes on her, I tasted a delicious combination of fear and strength. Weakness and bravery, sadness and resignation. Instincts and needs that I\'d buried and ignored volcanoes to the surface. I lost control. I broke every rule and I didn\'t give a fuck. She woke a part of me I didn\'t know existed, layered in ice and cold blooded disassociation.\" \n Roan \"Fox is a tortured soul who has lived a horrible life at the hands of the worse kind of people, who kidnapped and held him captive since he was six years old. He was beaten and tortured into conditioning to doing everything and anything they wanted including kill. \n \" No one would look at me and think I was slave. But I had been. I still was. I probably would be forever.\" \n Once he finally escapes he begins to live as a zombie version of himself, unable to touch or be touch, unable to please or be pleased, simply miserable, living a life void of emotions and filled with fear. That is until he meets Hazel Hunter and his miserable life changes forever. \n \"I\'ll give you two hundred thousand for one month of pure access. I want to buy your obedience, your body, your mind. But most of all I want to buy your secrets.\" \n \" Tonight, I did the one thing that made least sense of all. I bought a girl. And I would never let her go.\" \n \"Top rule. Unbreakable rule. Don\'t. Ever. Touch. Me.\" \n He begins to fight all his conditioning instincts to be a \"normal\" man for her. But as with everything in his life, nothing is ever that easy. The road to normalcy is not as easy as he thought it would be after only one look into Zel\'s eyes at his club. \n \" You\'re Mine, and I refuse to live without you.\" \n The battle with his own personal demons wasn\'t so easily won. He has to challenge himself again and again with fear of losing the only people he loves. \n \"Obey or I\'ll kill you.\" \n \"I\'m here for you, for her. Forever if you\'ll have me. Just please-forgive me.\" \n Hazel \"Zel\" is a strong courageous woman, who fights with teeth and nail to save those she loves most. She instantly feels the connection between her and Fox and gives up herself in order to try to help him find his cure to his conditioning without losing her life along the way. But her secret can kill them both... \n \" No, I\'m not okay. Everything about you tells me to run, yet I ignore myself and end up getting hurt again. I find myself needing to help others-it\'s a compulsion driving me insane.\" \n \" You mistreat me, and I\'ll make you dickless for the rest of your life. Treat me with respect and desire and I\'ll stay. I accept your offer Obsidian Fox. Don\'t make me regret it.\" \n \" With fear and stupidity, I sold myself to him. Sold myself to a fighter who could sense my lies as easily as a fox senses a rabbit. \n I regretted it. I reveled in it. It destroyed me.\" \n Meanwhile she is also trying to save the life of the one person she loves most and she is afraid that in the end she will end losing them both. The life of her daughter, the life of the one person who has the ability to change everything. \n \"A child was my cure. The daughter of the woman I tried to kill. It was time to face my past full of darkness and say fuck you. It was time to start new memories.\" \n \"Her touch shattered me. Her touch awoke me. Her touch destroyed me.\" \n Their love is like no other, together they fight every instinct in their body, to run, to harm, to kill. He doesn\'t think he has what it takes to be a good man for her, and she can\'t give up on him, It\'s a love that fights all battles and has the ability to destroy them both. \n \" You are worthy. Every day I spend with you, your improving.\" \n \"Only because I keep my distance and don\'t touch you. Believe me, if you knew my thoughts you would run.\" \n \"Do you want me to run?\" \n \"You should.\" \n \"You own me, body and soul, Hazel Hunter. You\'re not just my lover but also my handler and I will walk over blades for you. I will kill for you. I will lay down my life for you.\" \n So, with nothing left to say other than YOU MUST READ this book!! You will Love Fox, you will also hate him but don\'t let that scare you in the end he makes it worth the wait but you need to read it to find out. \n **** For More Reviews Visit My Blog**** \n www.Jenreadit.com'),

I don\'t normally drink but after all that I think I just may need one or 5! \n There has to be another book! \n Ok so I spent a big part of the book in a love, hate relationship with Twitch and Lexi. It\'s rare you read about a <\"hero\" like Twitch, and that makes him all that more interesting. \n \"There\'s something about Twitch. He\'s just raw.\" \n He is just all kinds of twisted, but at the same time he had his sweet, and happy moments with Lexi. These two together are just a complete loving mess. \n \"Don\'t feel sorry for me. And don\'t assume you know me. You don\'t know shit about me.\" \n The story begins when we meet 6 year old Alexa, trying to take care of a beat up 8 year old Antonio. She feels sorry for him and tries to help him as best as she can. But what she doesn\'t realize is that little act of kindness, changed both of their lives forever. \n \"You\'re hurt.\" \n \"No one else cares if I\'m hurt.\" \n I whisper, \"I do.\" \n We stand there, staring at each other a long time. Finally, he comes closer to me and asks, \"What\'s your name?\" \n \"Alexa. Alexa Ballentine.\" He nods but says nothing. \n Finally he comes closer to me and asks, \"What\'s your name?\" \n \"Doesn\'t matter. You\'ll forget it once I\'m gone.\" \n Stepping closer, I promise, \" No, I won\'t.\" \n Lifting his head, he runs a hand through his messy brown hair to keep it out of his face. He watches me a second more before he utters, \"Antonio Falco.\" \n As I read this book several parts of if made me contemplate putting it down and moving on to another book less... RAW... But that\'s just the thing though, the story of Twitch and Lexi was just so intense and captivating that I had to keep reading and had to know if they did get their HEA. \n \"Monsters don\'t always lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they hide in plain sight.\" \n \"I don\'t want a knight in shining armor. \n I don\'t want a knight in scuffed armor. \n I want his helmet to have dents. I want my knight to be real, and dark and savage. I want my knight to be a survivor. Someone who\'s been tested and got through his trails. Not some pussy in gleaming metal.\" \n So yes listen to the author\'s note, This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong. So if you can\'t handle reading a book that will strip you bare with every dark, twisted, compelling, heart wrenching page. \n \"You\'ll be forever unsatisfied. No one will ever take care of you the way I can. The way I know you want it. I know what you need, Lexi, even if you don\'t know it yourself. But I\'ll teach you.\" \n I won\'t give much of the story away because reading it all for yourself is an experience you don\'t want to miss, so I don\'t want to ruin it for you. I\'ll just leave you with this... If you want a crazy complicated, heart stopping, soul wrenching story then you this is a MUST READ for you! \n (view spoiler)[\" She\'s in danger, though. And I need to keep her safe. Because I love her. I\'d kill anyone who tried to hurt her. You said you\'d never leave me. And I\'m holding you to that.

It\'s a bittersweet feeling because in a way it\'s good for the anticipation on what will happen next, but in this case NOT SO MUCH! Great read that may leave you blushing and wanting more... Now how can I explain my feelings about this book properly without giving too much away ??? \n \"Cross was too hot for his own good. I couldn\'t let his Zeus like looks and charming mouth derail my plans.\" \n \" Of course I liked him! Even Mother Teresa would have liked him.\" \n \"I don\'t sleep around, Allie. I\'m a one-girl kind of man.\" \n I think that pretty much covers it Right? Other than screaming HOT DAM!!!! \n So to Sum up, Allie needs Tristan for her Revenge Tristan needs Allie for his Rescue, the lines get blurred and things get OH SO INTERESTING!! \n \" Hit me.\" I could have sworn I\'d heard a slight growl in his voice. \n \"What?\" \n \"It\'s not a request. If you want me to consider you for the job you need to pin me to the floor.\" \n \"You just want me on top of you.\" I crossed my arms at my front. \n \" Actually I want you under me, and I wont have it any other way.\" He grinned \n I loved the story of Allie and Tristan, It was a mixture of the beginning of their love but also gave you an insight on one of the biggest worldwide issues we have today... SEX TRAFFICKING. Allie has to go under cover to get sold as a sex slave in order to try to save Tristan\'s ex from being sold. It was crazy to see the reality of sex trafficking. As much as I hated reading about what some of the women went through in the book, because I know it\'s a reality in our lives more than we\'d like it to be, it was a good way of showing the readers what many women out there are going through. \n \"If I had a choice I wouldn\'t hire you. I\'d keep you far away from the scum we\'ll be dealing with. But you\'re too perfect for the job. You\'re beautiful, smart and strong.\" \n But on a lighter note... Allie and Tristan Cross were a great pair. They completed each other\'s every need with trust in each other from day one. The chemistry between these two simply left me fanning myself... \n \"Cocky a bit? \n \" I guess you\'ll have to wait and see. \" \n \"You\'re unbelievable.\" \n \" I Know. And I\'m glad you know it, too. \" \n \"Have you always been a tease Allie? Or is it just for me? \n \"What?\" \n \"You say one thing but mean something else. I can see the way your body\'s reacting to me.\" I mean come on... What can you really say to that? \n \" You look beautiful when you blush.\" \n \" You should get off me.\" I felt my muscles tense.\" \n \"I should, and I will, but know that I don\'t want to.\" WOW!!! \n \" You taste much better than I imagined.\" \n \"Imagined?\" \n \"I wondered about your lips all night and couldn\'t sleep. Now I don\'t have to wonder anymore.\" \n \"I\'m glad I satisfied your curiosity.\" \n But as much as Allie tried to keep their relationship strictly professional it only worked for about 2 seconds. It was great to see the sparks between these two. Because honestly with a guy like Cross I don\'t really blame her! \n \" I\'d tasted forbidden fruit I couldn\'t get enough of. And I wanted more, I needed more.\" \n \" Mr. Impossibly hot could not only make me swoon in bed, but also in his kitchen.\" \n \" You perv!

But that is Ukraine. A boy on the streets without a gun is prey. I have never been prey.

But together they work on building their trust and love for one another even through the obstacles their old insecurities and fears throw their way. \n \" I knew I could not keep you,\" he says. His voice is hoarse with emotion. \"Such a beautiful, innocent soul. I just wanted you for as long as I could have you. I knew it was wrong, and I did not care.

(612, 67, 18, 4, '****4 Musical Stars \n Maybe Someday \n By: Colleen Hoover \n I can honestly say that I am a HUGE Colleen Hoover book fan! I have read both series she has written so far and LOVED everyone of them. She has a way with words that I can honestly say I have cried my eyes out in each one of her books. So with that in mind I have to say this book was a little different for me. It\'s a really good book, very well written and all I just didn\'t feel all of the emotions I am used to feeling when reading a Colleen Hoover book. Don\'t get me wrong I really enjoyed reading the story of Ridge and Sydney. The distinct and emotional way their love for music despite all obstacles pushed them together was amazing. There is no way to write a full review without giving too much away so I\'ll try my best to let the character\'s words speak for themselves. \n \"We try so hard to hide everything we\'re really feeling from those who probably need to know our true feelings the most.\" \n \"Sometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.\" \n It was beautiful to watch the two of them grow together, not only through their struggles but also through the obstacles life has thrown at them. To see them realize there is more to life then the issues they face. \n \"A life of mediocrity is a waste of a life.\" \n \"Words can sometimes have a far greater effect on a heart than a kiss.\" \n Music is what brings them together; it\'s what brings light to the great connection they share. Writing music together connects the two of them in a way they never thought possible to have with another. \n \"However, I\'ve learned that the heart can\'t be told when and who and how it should love. The heart does whatever the hell it wants to do. The only thing we can control is whether we give our lives and our minds the chance to catch up to our hearts.\" \n These challenges and the enormity of the connection they share lead them to doing things they never thought they would be capable of. \n \"I kiss her every way I can possibly kiss her, because I plan on loving her every way I can possibly love her. Every single time we refused to cave in to our feelings in the past makes this kiss completely worth the sacrifices.\" \n \"The more I open up to him, the more I need him. The more I admit to myself that I need him, the most it hurts to know that I still don\'t exactly have him.\" \n I am not going to lie, There were several times that I just wanted to shake Sydney and Ridge and tell them to just make up their mind already but then there was the soft side of me that can understand their struggle. \n \"There\'s no other way to describe how I feel. I know that the way I think about her and feel about her is wrong, but I struggle so much with how right it feels when I\'m with her.\" See what I Mean??? \n \"Never in all my life and in all my years of living in a world of silence have I wanted to hear something as much as I want to hear her sing right now. I want to hear her so bad it physically hurts.\" \n I mean seriously??? How can your heart not hurt for these two after Ridge saying something like that? Getting to know Ridge and the difficulties he has gone through opened my eyes to what it would be like to go through the same things. It\'s crazy to see that it is a reality and what sometimes can tare someone apart can also bring others together. \n \"God, if just holding hands with him feels this intense, I can\'t imagine what everything else with him would feel like.\" \n \"I don\'t know when you\'ll be ready for me. It might be next month or next year. Whenever it is, just know that I have absolutely no doubt that we can make this work. I know we can. If there are two people in this world capable of finding a way to love each other, it\'s us.\" So pretty much READ this book, like right now! You will LOVE it trust me!! \n www.jenreadit.com'),

(627, 68, 30, 5, 'Death as an issue is not what one expects to find in young adult fiction. It is central to this coming-of-age story and adroitly handled. Accompanying this central issue are the expected themes: sexual awakening, conflicts with parents, identity issues, choices to be made. \n Early in the book we see Donna, the narrator whose father has recently died, deciding to become a mortician. We follow her thinking on this as she navigates the world of senior year at high school. \n The ending, though predictable to adults, may not be predictable to the intended audience. And although I expected the resolutions, my interest was held to see how they would be effected. And for once, changes in the characters\' attitudes were adequately motivated and believable.'),
(628, 68, 46, 4, 'I had to keep reminding myself it was written in the 1950s, ten years before Stonewall. There was not much to locate it in time. I haven\'t decided if that is good--ie, makes it universal, or bad--missing its grounding in history. \n It was an intense study of the self-hatred promoted by the homophobia of the times and its disastrous effects of partners, both male and female. There were stereotypical characters, but the two main ones were well developed. \n It was a page turner, starting with something like this: tonight is the last night before the worst morning in my life. I liked the use of flashback to tell the story ( I seem to say that a lot.) The transitions of time were clear.'),
(629, 68, 84, 5, 'Written in 1988, set in the sixties when Zimbabwe was still Rhodesia, this novel follows two girls, who are cousins, in a mission school. One is the narrator, looking back at her life in the school from a more informed perspective. There is just enough of the mature commentary to remind us of the incomplete version of the younger girl. \n The first section describes Tambu\'s life on the family farm while her brother goes to school and her attempt to grow enough corn and sell it to get her own school fees. The next section shows her in the mission school living with her uncle, the headmaster, rooming with her cousin, Nyasha. The third section I will leave unidentified, for it would be a giveaway. \n In the second section as Tambu waits for her aunt, the description of the uncle\'s house conveys the difference between the conditions of the native population and the privileged black population. Only very indirectly do we get indications of the white population. The events that follow reveal the identity issues the two girls face. \n I have just learned that a sequel was published in 2006 and look forward to reading it.');

(630, 68, 93, 4, '** spoiler alert ** \n I enjoyed this third book almost as much as the first two. The plot had as many twists and turns and dangers, mostly overcome. I was not too surprised that Coin turned out to be a power grabber, and liked the way she was dispatched with. \n I liked the way the author avoided killing off either Gale or Peeta; however, I felt the way she dispensed with Gale was lame. First his observation that Katniss only loved him when he was injured or needy and second his observation that the only thing he had had going was protecting her family. These did not ring true. And to blame him for Prim\'s death because it may have been a weapon that he created also seemed a stretch. Their hunting times had given them a much deeper bond than that. \n Having the media people around almost all the time intensified the commentary on reality TV, and having the two versions of news underlined the importance of knowledge in making decisions and of the press. The three books together seem an indirect commentary on war video games that prepare for real war and the victors recognized the Hunger Games in the way the Capitol was booby trapped and even named the revolution Hunger Games 76. \n I was surprised at Katniss voting for Hunger Games with the children of the decision makers of the Capitol. I could see the revenge aspect. I could see avoiding total depletion of population. But it didn\'t seem in character for how much she had hated the games or for her moments of realizing that people in the capitol were people too. So I am on the fence on that issue. \n 11/30/15 On rereading after the movie. I see Katniss\'s vote as strategy toward her new goal of killing President Coin rather than as a character inconsistency. I see an intensification of the critique of the gamelike quality of the war in looking at contemporary drone warfare. \n Perhaps Katniss\'s thought, expressed only once, makes enough sense to justify her shift from Gale to Peeta: She didn\'t need Gale\'s anger; she had enough of her own. She needed Peeta\'s attitude for balance. She probably could have ended up happy with either. Whenever objecting to Gale\'s attitudes and strategies, she balanced it with thoughts of her own actions that caused deaths of others, thoughts made all the more important in these days of drone strikes and \"collateral damage.\" Not enough that Prim is killed trying to attend the wounded, there is also the tragic irony that Katniss became a tribute in order to save her in the beginning, and the book ends with her death. \n I see WWII connections I had missed in the last parachute attack being unnecessary because Snow was ready to surrender. [I\'d not believed him on the first read, but came closer to believing him on the second, though the ambiguity is pretty strong.] Also the double attack after medical aid has come in parallels Nagasaki after Hiroshima. And the \"war to end all wars\" comments.'),
(631, 68, 27, 5, 'I had read that it was merely a repeat of The Hunger Games, but decided to read it anyway. And I am glad I did. The revolutionary potential of Katniss\' actions has been noted and promoted a new level of oversight and punishment. It read equally as well as the first one.'),
(632, 68, 70, 5, 'Quite a good read. For once an ending seemed well handled--only one small piece seemed extraneous. Some excellent character development. I had forecast a totally different ending, and mine would have worked well also, but this one was better. I find that I enjoy being right in forecasting the ending, and I also enjoy being surprised by being wrong when it is well done.'),
(633, 68, 92, 3, 'This book should have been a nonfiction book presenting the silk factories. The plot and characters seemed to exist only to illustrate an aspect of Chinese history or factory conditions or options in 1920-30s China for women. \n I am intrigued by the hair dressing ceremony wherein women could choose to become a member of the sisterhood of silk workers, an alternative to arranged marriages. A parallel ceremony to marriage; the choice as permanent. Like secular nuns. \n Even if the factories allowed women to escape family and marriage, even if it allowed them to send some support home, it is not a good excuse for running a sweatshop, and this factory did become/was always that--hence the strike. However, the strike was unconvincing; the results too easy. I have read about the labor movement\'s beginning in the US of A, and I must confess that I am now interested to learn to what extent there was a parallel movement in China, and if indeed it was that much easier than in the US. \n There seemed an abrupt shift from isolated rural to involvement with the Japanese invasion. While it was abrupt, it may have reflected the awareness of the rural people as the fighting moved closer to them. So I have mixed feelings about the ending. There were slight hints earlier of trouble up north. The entrance of difficulties still felt sudden and intrusive. Maybe war is like that.'),
(634, 68, 23, 4, 'Some very interesting character development, an attention holding plot. Some historic information about World War II women prisoners (though the country was changed). \n Once the main character became an entrepreneur, it became unbelievable, but still a fun read.'),
(635, 69, 98, 5, 'Two things appealed to me about this book. First, I am fascinated by animals learning human language, had read about Nim Chimsky long ago and was fascinated by the use of sign language with animals. I appreciated the notes at the end leading to research backing the novel actions and to the comment that most of the ape - human conversation was based on real conversations, although the book was fiction. \n Second, it was a real page turner with twists and turns. Some events I could figure out ahead and some surprised me, a nice balance.'),
(636, 69, 70, 5, 'After reading that the author has both Armenian and Turkish ancestors I appreciated the history of the book more. As with many novels with a historical context, it dealt with history that I am not overly familiar with. \n I appreciated the character development most throughout this rather slowly paced novel. The aunts progressed from grotesques in the beginning to loveable characters by the end. The plot had enough twists and turns to really hold my interest. I both enjoyed and got frustrated by the alternating families and settings. The author gave clues to help keep characters\' contexts straight, but not clues as to which of many in some listings to remember. I guess that is what second readings are for.'),
(637, 69, 3, 2, 'The plot a page turner. The maids reflect the Mammy stereotype. I would like to see the story written by one of the maids. I recommend Maid in the USA by Mary Romano as a corrective. It is an ethnography about real live maids along with research about labor law and how it hasn\'t been applied to housemaids. \n The dialect was a sad imitation of Black Vernacular English.'),

The movement between past and present is often quick, mere hints, but gradually they pile up into a whole.The treatment of women is an extension of attitudes as current now as when the book was written. \n For quite a number of pages, the pace remained slow; the life restricted routine. Various liaisons later and the pace quickens. \n For once an ending is well done. (view spoiler)[There is ambiguity whether she is taken by friend or foe at the end. Then there are the scholars\' reports in the 2100s after the finding of the journal that is the novel. The ambiguity is only partially resolved.

There is also the claim that past generations and history are essential to understanding identity along with future events caused by actions or inactions of the person; however, this idea is undercut almost as often as it is presented. \n On the first reading I was just confused. On the second I kept better track of the characters because I remembered most of the names that reappeared. I was also better able to keep track of India/Pakastan history and politics the second time through. \n I laughed frequently, but most heartily at the chapter \"Hit the Spittoon\" and at the courtship in fragments with the sheet with the hole. Fragmentation imagery abounds in the story and in the related history. \n Rushdie presents an interesting study of relativity. One memorable mention was this: India is a land of alternative realities and Pakastan a land of infinite falsehoods. (Not quite quoted exactly) Another is the section about the India/Pakastan war that juxtaposes the headlines from newspapers from each country.

That is not the author\'s fault. \n Clara and Myrna and Ruth are major characters in this one as they were in the ones before. The focus shifts among other villager/ investigator people, though some of them seem to be steady players. The major ones continue to be well developed and interesting. And mostly likable. \n When reading a later book and coming across a reference to \"the Arnot case\" I\'d expected one of the earlier books to be about it. However, the first book also referred to it in the past. There was a bit of explanation in #2 and more in #3, for which I was grateful. \n This third in the series is the best so far (after a rather odd beginning with a seance).

(645, 69, 53, 5, 'The primary thing for me in a mystery is how well the various options for solution are kept open till the end. In this book that was accomplished very well.

In the later books, there is no online connectivity from Three Pines; in the earlier ones there is, albeit Slow.

And interesting fact: I\'d always assumed references to prior cases were references to prior books. However, here in the first book are references to prior cases. Either it is just part of the needed context or there will be a new novel set before this first one. Time will tell. \n Also amusing. Here in the first one, cell phones worked in Three pines. In the later ones they don\'t. \n And as far as I can tell, an inconsistency within this first one: an early scene takes place in the bistro and it is about a delay; later when that delay is explained, it also happened at the bistro, so would have been impossible for the waiting person to have missed it. Small detail. \n One thing I enjoy about Penny\'e mysteries is the characterization, and it is present in this early book. And she does well at red herring clues among the real clues.'),

Lessens the anxiety as \"the plot thickens.\" But I think I\'ll go back to the beginning for the rest. \n Nov. 2, 2016 \n Having read #1-#8, I returned to this one. I had forgotten many details already, so it was an interesting read again. Plus details had more meaning after having read the previous volumes. After the less intriguing #8, my interest in this one was much higher. Back in Three Pines, the villagers again appeared, some growing, some not.

If so, I will enjoy it. \n This one was well paced and had the right amount of twists, false leads, and turns; however, I am not convinced the ending was inevitable or the best possible. One structural thing I found a little disconcerting was the extremely short segments before switching points of view. \n One thing I have liked about the two I have read was that character development is as important as solving the mystery. \n I will be reading more of the series. Back references are explained enough for those of us reading out of order, but I\'d guess it would be more fun if you knew the back story. it will be a different kind of reading fun to read them, knowing what story follows. \n January 2017 \n I am reading the series in order; yes, it is more fun reading this one and knowing the various back stories. I found the short segments less distracting than on first read, maybe because I knew the outcome so was less interested in knowing what happened and what was going to happen. I also found the ending more believable, maybe because I caught more of the details along the way.'),

Luckily the really gross and bloody part occurred only briefly at the beginning. The next oddity was the father deciding to produce his own freak show for the carnival (based on his seeing horticultural variety at the International Test Rose Garden). The mother dutifully took drugs to alter her offspring. Their living children were four: Arty with fins for arms and legs; Elly and Iphy, the Siamese twins; Oly, the hunchbacked, dwarf narrator; and Chick the youngest, with his special powers. \n Had it not been a group read, I might have stopped there. However, I remembered a comment of a professor about other novels with \"grotesques\": What could the author say through them that couldn\'t be said through more average characters? I decided to read a bit more through that frame. Then the next chapter captured my attention with its narrative strategy of jumping into the future with Oly and her daughter Miranda. Several events are revealed that make a reader wonder how they happened. That same strategy is used a few more times, like a carrot to keep one reading. For the first two thirds of the book, the pacing was very effective. Then the notes of a reporter/participant were introduced, and while they provided important information that Oly, the narrator, couldn\'t have known, they dragged the pace considerably. Also the very ending of the book, while motivated, seemed to take too long. It also left me wondering to what extent it was a change in her character instead of an extension. \n I have not yet answered the What could be said question. First hypothesis, something about disability issues. Did not hold up. Second hypothesis, something about minorities. The carnival provided a sort of ghetto where deformities were normal; however, the carnival was dependent on the money of the norms buying tickets. Oly didn\'t feel odd till she no longer lived in the carnival setting. \n One group member read an interview with the author and learned she is an environmentalist and is anti-war. Perhaps the father\'s manipulation is an extreme of the various pollutants in our atmosphere, food, and water. And there was one paragraph in the reporter\'s notes where Arty ponders how people could criticize his followers who are maimed by choice and not criticize war with the injuries it produces. Maybe. And is it really choice when there is cult-like power in the leader and manipulation? I feel the need to think more on the followers\' willingness to endure amputation and what it might say about other things we readers may be willing to give up and for what.'),

(654, 70, 29, 4, 'I heard Percy at the local Wordstock day, and I was drawn to read the book by the description of bringing the Lewis and Clark expedition into the future apocalypse. Actually I think the main link to history is the naming of characters. (I googled names of those on the expedition and yes they were on the original, but not necessarily similar. For example Clark is a female ranger, though she led the book\'s expedition; York is her half brother, though it is indicated he is dark.) I saw two parallels: Lewis kept a journal and the two got separated for a piece. Maybe someone who knows more about the historical trek would see more subtle parallels. \n The pacing was intense. There were always several subplots going, and moving back and forth was pretty well signaled--only occasionally confusing. The shifts created many cliff hangers. It was very hard to put down at bedtime. (And you can see I didn\'t put it down many times.) There were enough twists and turns, but not too many. \n The main characters were fairly rounded and developed. Some of the minor ones less so, having no dimension beyond their evilness. The setting was vividly described: hot, cold, mutations, past history; the ongoing fires in oil fields were quite convincing. There were interesting references to climate and country history as the group traveled through. \n If you like apocalyptic/adventure reading, you would like it.'),

She fills her time and pays her bills making copies of paintings for a reproduction service --not a crime when sold as reproductions. And she is a Degas specialist. The story is fiction, but is based on the fact of a still unsolved theft from the Gardener Museum. Painting and painter detail is important to the plot and interesting as well. \n The plot moves between the painter\'s present copying of a Degas for a gallery dealer, as part of a bargain to get her own show, to a past painting for a friend. Gradually we learn about her first bad decision. Interspersed are 19th century letters of the Gardener behind the museum to her niece; a note at the end tells what is history and what is fiction--the letters are fiction. \n As Claire, the artist, researches technique she begins to question the authenticity of the piece she is copying. She falls in love with the gallery dealer. And as they say, the plot thickens. The book is entertaining and from the middle, hard to put down.'),

Luckily there are a few places where all seems resolved and one can put it down to do something else. It took only a few pages to realize \"water war\" was not a metaphor. Sometimes it seemed there was more gory detail than necessary to make that point. The subplots merge in believable ways. The medical detail is not always so believable even with the future orientation. \n The major characters are mostly likable, though I did not always like all their decisions.

The second amazing thing is that it explained rowing to someone who had no clue (me) and little interest in sports in such a way that it was clear but not too much. \n The story of the road to the Olympics is told mostly from the perspective of Joe Rantz;however, as he requested, it is told in the context of \"the boat\"--more than the shell that they propelled with oars, \"the boat\" is the spirit of the team working together in perfect harmony. The physical boat too is a character, and Pocock, its maker, stands out as one filled with wisdom about people as well as rowing and boat building. \n The story is told in the context of the Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the drums of encroaching World War II. Joe\'s surmounting of personal struggles as well as economic is admirable.'),

Reading that the novel had seeds in Marie\'s story in Cowgirls: Women of the American West made me want to read that oral history too. \n I was delighted to read a book with the main character a woman doing \"man\'s\" work as an equal. (view spoiler)[ I would have preferred less of the romance. At first it seemed that the competent Woodruff sisters, who owned one ranch on her circuit, would remain her role model. I would have liked to see her strong and independent character remain. However, I was won over a bit with her demands when Henry proposed and his acceptance of them. (hide spoiler)] \n The characters are mostly well rounded, the positive ones more than the negative. The latter seem all bad throughout. \n The setting is 1917-18 so there are a few cars, a few ranches with telephones, and of course WWI in the background. \n The novel started rather slowly, but my interest intensified, and it was hard to put down after it got moving.'),
(659, 70, 13, 3, 'Taleb is writing theory, but he wants to relate it to experience, to work bottom up from experience. He is more interested in premises than the logic built from them.He eschews closed systems that have lost touch with lived reality. He wants practice to account for the black swan events (the unpredictable, rare event --positive or negative--with great impact). Current economic models do not. He is skeptical about what can be known or predicted, about models. He speaks of false confirmation (every white swan seems to confirm that swans are white; however, one black swan disproves it). He speaks of other thought processes that misguide. He occasionally speaks to how to live with uncertainty--ignore what has low impact, avoid the negative with high impact, or at least bolster yourself against the possibility, and seek to be open the the positive possibility. \n Where he does touch on practical measures (other than recommending we withhold judgment on important issues or bolster against loss) I find our ways diverging. He briefly touched on climate change. Though he agrees it is a problem, he is skeptical of the modeling there too. And though he thinks the misleading of financial models is a problem, he blames regulation for creating the need for predicting. \n The book vacillated between interesting and tedious. Although Taleb nodded to art, literature, and medicine, most of his arguments and examples came from the world of finance, an unfamiliar (and minimally interesting) world to me. He appears to be trying to introduce paradigm shift into financial/risk management thinking, and as such has to give more arguments and evidence than I as a lay person needed.'),
(660, 70, 43, 5, 'After reading an intriguing review in the Women\'s REeiew of Books, I had to read the book. From the review I learned that the novel included two related narratives; half of the editions started with the one narrated by the 15th Century painter, the other half by the daughter of a woman who had loved a painting by that artist. I don\'t think there is any way to tell which edition you are getting other than the illustration just before \"Chapter 1\" The girl\'s has the security camera, the artist\'s has eyes. I got the girl first, and I am glad. \n Both narratives are stream of consciousness with fluctuations from past to present. The girl\'s moves from life before her mother died to her present. The artists moves from his life and times to the girl\'s present as he follows her after she looks at one of his paintings. The links were harder to follow in the artist\'s section, and had I started reading there, I\'d have been quite disoriented much of the time. However, reading it second, I could use cues from the girl\'s earlier narrative. Of course I\'ll never know what it would have been like to start with the artist. \n Both stories were intriguing and held my attention. And as the review stated, juxtaposing them creates a third narrative. I have a lot of thinking to do on that third one. The characters seemed real and likable. \n There were so many \"boths\" to ponder being. Occasionally the author was a little heavy handed in reminding us to think about such distinctions, but that was rare and also forgivable. Some that I pondered were both living and dead, both old and new, both viewer and viewed, I\'m sure there are more. It is a book worth rereading.'),
(661, 70, 30, 5, 'The setting is the end of the Vietnam war; the main character tells us early on that he belongs to the North, but works under cover with the South. \n Presented as a spy novel, it is, but it isn\'t the thriller one might expect. It is more an exploration of character, of times, and of the interaction. It has philosophical moments that are entirely in character and not intrusive, thoughts on being of two minds, on representation, and on \"nothing.\" The latter was interesting, but I am not sure how seriously to take it. The former makes me think that if I were still teaching, I might join this book with How to Be Both in a unit. \n For me the theme of Who-Gets-to-Represent-Us? enters with the chapters about a movie script and its shooting. However, that was a ways into the novel, so I might reread to see if I missed its actual beginning. When the movie chapters appeared, they seemed an interruption, but gradually they were woven into the whole. \n The plot was slow, as character explorations tend to be, slow in a good sense. There were moments where action was faster paced and it was a page turner. There was a nice rhythm between the two. We are told early on that the narration is really a \"confession\" to a \"commandant,\" so we keep wondering what the narrator did to get him into that position. We also expect, and get, some torture scenes. They feel really long while reading them, but don\'t take a large percentage of pages. \n Some of the characters have names. Some don\'t, but rather are identified by position and sometimes affect: \"the crapulent major,\" the congressman,\" the \"affectless lieutenant.\" It would be worth a second read to look for a pattern of who gets named and who doesn\'t. It isn\'t wholly major/minor characters. It doesn\'t create stock characters. It may relate to the degree in intimacy with the narrator, but I\'m not ready to commit to that. \n It is a novel worth reading once to see how it ends; it is worth rereading to ferret out deeper meaning. \n Second Reading \n I marveled more at the skill of the stream-of-consciousness; the shifts were managed such that I almost always knew where I was in the larger narrative. And I marveled at turns of phrase and metaphors more than I noticed on the first reading. And, as usual on a second reading, I was more alert to how all the small parts fit together into the larger structure. \n I did list the characters named and unnamed; there seem to be an almost equal number of each. I still don\'t see a pattern, but will keep looking. \n The \'representation\' theme (view spoiler)[ morphed into an identity theme and the narrator shifted from \"I\" to \"we\" when speaking of himself. It seemed a culmination of his mother\'s saying he was not half but all of each nationality, a culmination of his finding his place in his two spy roles. (hide spoiler)] \n The ending and the play on \"nothing\" remain fascinating. (view spoiler)[ \"nothing\" becoming a positive and transforming the meaning of \"Nothing is more important than freedom and independence.\" Man, the blood brother and the commissar in charge of re-education, leads the narrator to see that what starts as revolution ends as a power grab, hence as \'nothing.\' And yet hope does not die. \n Reading the torture aka re-education scenes I wondered if that was intended to judge the communist side that the narrator had been working for as a double agent, the ending being a point of emphasis. And yet it was the CIA manual that they used to orchestrate the torture. So it was not a single, national judgment. (hide spoiler)] \n The narrative style changes abruptly at the end. The slow-paced narration of a life becomes a mix of first and third person reporting and told contemporaneously with events rather than as memory. It also becomes more philosophical, though still not intrusive.'),

He offers a critique of traditional nursing homes, of what \"assisted living\" has become, and of medical practice based more on procedures than persons. His illustrations with case studies--some showing failure, others showing success--take the book beyond theory to readable. \n Gawande challenges the narrow focus on safety and extending life and replaces it with concern for quality of life. He notes that people making quality-of-life decisions for patients often think in terms of what they, themselves, want, not what the patient would want. He questions the Maslow hierarchy\'s application to all ages and stages. \"Freedom to be the author of our lives\" within whatever circumstances we are dealt becomes primary. He offers discussion questions for medical personnel and family to use to understand what the patient sees as desirable quality of life, then urges discussion of ways to accomplish it.'),

The twists and turns and clues and red herrings were interesting to follow as the book forged on to solve the whodunnit. \n Usually I like a novel with several stories that end up merging. These were somehow annoying. They merged from the beginning and the shifts were annoying and confusing. I resented having to look back at chapter headings to see what was simultaneous and what past. \n Characterization: Tom was well developed. Rachel was sometimes a convincing alcoholic, sometimes not.

Grandfather (called by two names: Worried Man and Billy) pursues a quest. Readers are drawn into the town and the lives of the characters slowly; narratives shift among the characters as well to enrich our understanding of the town\'s people. \n The style is both beautiful and annoying. Overall the description is part of the pleasure of reading, however, occasionally the cataloguing gets to be tedious. Usually, however, it is enriching and beautiful. One device I particularly enjoyed was the cataloguing based on one image. For example, the statement, Everyone is kneeling, is followed by a listing of all the characters kneeling in various ways--not churchy at all, some kneeling in a garden, for example. It provides a kind of summary before moving on to another scene.'),

However, many deductions seem too advanced even for a precocious child. And many behaviors too childish for eleven. Once you forgive that, it is a good read. \n The plot held my attention in spite of several unbelievable coincidences. There were enough false leads, just plausible enough, that when the solution appeared, I was surprised. A nice light read for a day at the airport.'),

I thought that quite a challenge. And then characters from each side link up at the end, and of course I wanted to know how. (I\'d expected a more psychological linking than happened.) \n I did not find the handling equal. The Sinhalese family was presented in two generations, the Tamil one. The Sinhalese family was presented as aware of the civil war and ultimately leaving the country; the Tamil family as actually participating in the war. It is the latter that made it seem more sympathetic to the Tamil cause. \n Those things said, it was an interesting read and I learned more about the Sri Lankan civil war than I had known.'),

It is a mix of memoir (what it feels like to \"lose one\'s mind\") and journalism (the author using her reporting skills to fill in where her memory fails). \n The medical disease presents a mix of psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, mood swings,among others) along with physical symptoms (numbness of one side, seizures). Solution was further complicated by medical tests coming back normal. At one point Cahalan remarks how her disease could not have been found with current medical practice\'s emphasis on speedy visits and the bottom line. It took a doctor with time to listen and heed all the relevant data, some of which had fallen through the cracks in the previous exams. It also could not have been treated without a hefty health insurance an a family able to pay what the insurance would not. \n The narrative is mostly chronological and the story well paced. First you read to see what is wrong and then to see how she recovers.(It is not a spoiler to say she recovered; one can figure that out because she has written the book.) Medical information and social commentary are tucked into the narrative in small, readable bits.'),

She does one a year--never intending to publish them; the joy is in the doing. She has a very distant relationship with the other women in her apartment building, mostly observing them and commenting (usually negatively) on their behavior. \n Because she is so bookish she frequently alludes to or quotes from a large number of books, some familiar and some not. Sometimes the references are apt. It doesn\'t matter if they are recognized or not to the content of the allusions, but there are times when it slows the action to a grinding halt and seems intrusive, beyond characterizing the old woman. \n And the fault I find with so many books: the ending is not believable.'),

AFter the second is introduced, readers quickly learn the connection, though the main conflict takes a dozen or so more pages to be revealed. From there on, it is hard to put the book down. \n Sophie, the WWI heroine, is presented at first as feisty and fast thinking. One thinks of The Zookeeper\'s Wife and her various close calls averted by on-the-spot thinking.

The imagery of glaciers calving appeared twice: on the imagined trip from Seattle back to Alaska and later to describe the parents\' relationship: everything important calved away. \n To Isabella the glacier represented her life in Alaska when the family was whole. \n Isabella dwelt in the past through her shopping in vintage shops for everything and her career in the library repairing old books.

Most of the characters were likable, some took a while and a revelation or two to achieve that status. Only one, Patrick, never became likable to me. \n Whose story was it, Lou\'s or Will\'s? I think Lou\'s. And that is one reason it had to end as it did. She could not have gone on considering herself the reason Will stayed alive. Just think of the reaction when she moved in with Patrick. The mother\'s reaction colored future decisions of Lou and how she could present herself. Her life would have been totally stifled, thinking what effect any decision she made would have on Will. It would have become a prison. \n And I think it good that there was no love-solves-all ending. \n The book did a good job of exposing peoples\' reactions to people with visible disabilities, the lack of adequate modifications to ease their independence, the difficulty of negotiating details. And it alerts to some possibilities that exist \n But where were the adaptive equipment and counseling. Why hadn\'t some counselor gotten Will the computer equipment long before Lou introduces it; why hadn\'t he been introduced to the online quad support group. Why didn\'t he get to the group instead of Lou. There were sports he could do, and nothing was wrong with his mind. He could have continued at his job. \n Even though it was a good read, I was put off by stereotypes. It was written from an able-bodied bias that life without an able body is not worth living. (I do realize there would be no plot if that were taken away.) I remember a discussion once on differences between stereotype and experience: the able bodied says a person is \"confined to a wheel chair\"; the person in the chair sees it as a mobility device, as freeing them to be able to get around, not confined.'),

It would prompt PETA actions. \n Occasionally and briefly questions are raised about our attitudes toward death, but the questions are raised and dropped, when detailed discussion would be profitable. \n What I really objected to was the attempt at humor.

The chapters alternate with hers, her fiance\'s and an aunt\'s, gradually filling readers in on needed background. The struggle, in addition to regaining memories, involves re-establishing a relationship--or not.

It was funnier at the beginning; got a little old by page 300 and there were about 50 more pages to go. To what extent was this tale of a non-political person inadvertently influencing political decisions meant to be commentary as well as entertainment? I\'m not sure. If it is meant to show illogic in decision making, it does not provide a pretty picture. The bumbling police and journalists also do not create confidence, but they made me laugh a lot.

Time is marked by the birthdays of the narrator who was seven at the beginning of the novel; otherwise day runs into day to the reader, as it probably would to those experiencing the relocation and forced labor and hunger. At least twice the dark irony of \"improvements\" upon the ways of the peasant rice farmers appears, \"improvements\" that ignore accumulated wisdom and inevitably fail. \n Sometimes that wisdom is told as overheard conversations. Occasionally the child narrator\'s observations and questions are convincingly childlike; however, overall, the depth of thought and beauty of description is more adult. And yet even though it was difficult to remember the age of the narrator, I am not sure I would have wanted to give up the language with which the tale was told. Perhaps an omniscient narrator would have worked better. Still, no narrator choice is without loss as well as gain. \n There is a point where the mother decodes a note; I wondered both, Why so late? and Would she have been able to use the information if she had understood it earlier? Also I wondered at the two dimensional nature of the child military, the Khmer Rouge. Perhaps that is all a seven to ten year old child could see, but rarely is someone pure evil. \n There is more beauty than flaw in this novel, and it provides insight into a time it behooves us to understand.'),
(681, 72, 52, 4, 'First reading(2013) \n I am hooked on the series, The Cemetery of Forgotten Books. This second book had more violence than I remember in the first one, but the plot wasn\'t limited to escapes and failures at escaping. There is character development, mystery, and philosophizing too. And as in the first book, in this one there are cross overs between a novel the narrator is reading and the narrator\'s experiences. \n Description keeps the other worldly atmosphere vivid, at times almost Poe-like. Although at times I wanted the author to \"get on with the story,\" I usually appreciated the scene and mood setting. \n Second reading (2016) \n I did not enjoy this second book as much as the first of the series on this second reading of both. I had forgotten enough that familiarity doesn\'t explain the difference.

A few who made short appearances were two-dimensional. We learned many ways to be Nigerian and American through the characters, but none of them existed only to be illustrations. \n I enjoyed all 580+ pages, and was in suspense till the very end as to the conclusion. And I would have found it a satisfying read if it had ended in two of the three ways I\'d anticipated, tolerable for the third. And every page was necessary to get to that conclusion. \n The narrative movement was not chronological, though there was a clear timeline to the present section. The back story appeared more thematically as it related to the present story. The bulk of the novel was back story. \n The social commentary was well handled, never controlling the narrative, appearing often through Ifemelu\'s blog--first through subject lines, then through actual entries. Other appearances through conversations of Ifemelu and her friends. Always natural and appropriate to the context. \n The style is worth remarking. Vivid descriptions help evoke an unfamiliar world. Images, such as \"yet there was cement in her soul\" (7) and \"the air wrinkling between them\"(338) evoke the interior of the characters and conversations. \n It leads me to want to read her other works.'),

I like the way the fictive novel became a character and its people and plot appeared in our novel. \n I will have to think how to say the rest, whether to create a spoiler or if I can say things without spoiling. \n A group I am in has chosen it for this month, so I am rereading it (March 2016) \n Sometimes plot structure is more clear on a second reading--who is speaking? who is who? what happened before? I am sure I made connections on this reading that I missed on the first. \n The boy, Daniel, is taken by his father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books to select one to remember and take care of. He chooses The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Corax, and he begins a search for information about the author. Thus a past story and a present story emerge, stories with many parallels, but not totally parallel--nothing that predictable. One has to read attentively to track which story\'s background fits the current chapter. \n The narrator for most is Daniel, but there is a surprise section narrated by another with occasional details that seem impossible (or maybe I missed a cue somewhere). However, the lapse, if it is a lapse is minor. \n It is a first book of a series that inspires reading the next two. Another one promised.'),
(684, 73, 5, 4, 'After the second reading (2015) \n One of the pleasures of a second reading is that no longer needing to find out \"what happens next?\" frees one to enjoy other features. And to revise previous opinions. Or to see that the wrong questions were asked. I started reading with a focus on Ruth, as planned. The more I read the more I realized that it was not really two stories alternated, but one continuous narrative, that Ruth\'s portions could not be separated from Nao\'s. (view spoiler)[ There was so much preparation for Ruth\'s dream encounter with Nao\'s father, Haruki, that it wasn\'t deus ex machina at all. Early on Ruth had two dreams of Jiko. There was the time discussion where Oliver reminds Ruth of the ten years that had passed from the writing of the journal to the present. There were the statements of Jiko involving apparent contradictions being equally true and the flow of identity and time. It is \"background\" until the disappearance of words in the journal. (hide spoiler)] \n I still feel the philosophy was mostly well integrated. Possibly more actual Buddhist early on and more new age when it gets heavier at the end. \n I could pause and savor the many puns on \"time being,\" such as \"Mind and words are time being. Arriving and not-arriving are time being\" (347). Also enjoyable were the meditations on moments and on \"now/Nao.\" \n While I had intended a second reading eventually, I am glad for my book group selecting the book to prompt me to do it. \n After the first reading (2014) \n One of my favorite narrative structures is one that combines a past (through letters or journals) and a present story. And that is the basic structure of this novel. Ruth in the Pacific Northwest on a remote island finds a packet containing a journal and other objects washed up on shore, possibly from the earthquake and tsunami a couple years before, . The chapters alternate between Ruth, the finder and Nao, the writer. At first I wondered why Nao would have written a journal in English--it became clear when she revealed that she had spent her early life in California. \n The pacing is interesting. Instead of racing through the journal, Ruth paces herself slowly to reflect the pace it was written. In addition there is a French journal and some letters in old Japanese--these do not get translated immediately, but add essential information when they do. \n The characters are well drawn, sometimes interesting, sometimes ordinary. Sometimes likable sometimes less so--but as more is revealed, the major characters become more likable. The minor ones, the school contemporaries, not so much. At one point in the middle I found myself wondering about Ruth\'s chapters. Would her story be worth a novel without having found the journal? What were the parallels that were going to pull the two narratives together? I may reread it and focus more on Ruth, though the natural focus is Nao. \n Science, philosophy and religion were woven into the novel, generally not too heavily, though heavier at the end. The novel is a kind of exploration of time, of existences, of influence. How seriously are we to take the question of who is creating whom? I was intrigued by the moments of magical realism, though I have not yet decided if they were integral or an easy solutions to narrative problems. (view spoiler)[ Was the happy ending believable? Contrived? I realize \"happy\" may be a stretch since the father and daughter may have perished in the tsunami--this possibility leads to calling it ironic rather than happy; however, the question remains about Ruth\'s intervention in the father\'s intended suicide. (hide spoiler)] And did I learn about Buddhism or New Age cooptations of Buddhism? I will ponder these when I reread also. \n ETA more thoughts in the spoiler section'),

Thomas More, of course I knew, but I had a more holy opinion of him that of one who tortured and pursued heretics. \n There were two things about the writing style that I really disliked: overuse of short choppy sentences. Wild abandon with pronoun reference. Sentence 1 of a paragraph would be about one male character. Sentence 2 and following would have the \"he\" refer to Thomas Cromwell. Yet it was not always so. It would take reading a whole paragraph or more to know for sure who was talking sometimes. \n One thing about not knowing Tudor history well: I didn\'t always know how some subplot would turn out.(Anne and More I did, but it was still interesting to see how events worked out.) \n I liked it enough to read the next two books.

I had not heard enough to know ahead of reading it that it was fiction, so that disappointed me. However, it appears to have been researched such that it presents a plausible interior picture of Alice\'s mental status. I wondered, though, if the rapid deterioration were accurate. \n The family is borderline dysfunctional: Alice and her husband differing on the younger daughter\'s choice and the husband supporting the daughter behind Alice\'s back; Alice and that daughter\'s inability to communicate or understand each other at the beginning. On the other hand the two older children relate well to both parents and live nearby, so we see them more often. The marriage has been drifting into separate lives. I found the daughters and son likable, Alice likable, but the husband less so. (view spoiler)[ Lydia and Alice become close as the book progresses. The change seemed abrupt and not adequately motivated. (hide spoiler)] \n The story is told from Alice\'s point of view, enabling us to see inside, to feel the frustration of not remembering words and responsibilities and the panic at moments when she is lost. There is enough conversation and other detail for us to see what is happening outside of her thinking at times that her perceptions and external reality don\'t match up.'),

Occasionally Death provided historical context for the intended YA audience, and some meditations were worthwhile, but most of the comments were intrusions for me. \n ETA I just learned that it was not originally published as YA book in Australia.

The author seemed to realize that possibility and did a lot of summary narrative in the last third, but it was still hard to finish. I had anticipated how each would end. I like to be a little bit surprised. \n At one point Reiko narrates a situation with a piano student. On first reading, I did not see where it was necessary to the plot or the reading experience.

Nanapush has a significant role, and others make a cameo appearance (Father Damien, a character from The Bingo Palace, and two other families whose names I recognized but can\'t think of now). \n There is an interesting balance between the tense plot moments and boyish day-to-day moments as the plot moves inevitably onward to a satisfying ending.

There were few characters, though towns and other activities were implied. The characters were well developed with flaws and virtues--all but one, who had no redeeming qualities. \n Much of the book was about ideas never stated (the Orchardist himself, Jane and Della, sometimes Caroline Middey, though she was the most likely to speak) or about inability to speak (Clee). Angeline was more the one who wanted to know than one not communicating. Each had their own type of isolation, though there were also relationships. \n The novel deals with aging, birth, the growing up of children, and the diminished abilities of the elderly, always matter of factly, sometimes understated. Never heavy handed philosophizing. \n This is a rare book that remains excellent through the ending. (view spoiler)[No strong woman is forced to marry. The orchard doesn\'t last forever.

(697, 73, 82, 4, '** spoiler alert ** \n Generally, I like the slow pace of 19C novels, the extended description of setting and person. I like getting drawn into the fictitious world. I like the battles of wits and psychological studies. And this novel has those. \n I like that the novel is narrated as if it were a memoir, written (we learn at the end) ten years after most events. \n I dislike the hints of Beauty and the Beast mythology in Jane and Rochester. Yes, he does get tamed and become likeable; but I get tired of seeing women put into the civilizing role. \n I tolerated the moralizing via various characters as part of 19C until we came to St John. He was just too preachy and went on way too long. At first I shrugged it off as part of his character, and I hypothesized that Bronte was mocking him in presenting it to excess, especially when he claims that he has God\'s will for someone else, for Jane, who had no such internal push to become a missionary. Then I came to the ending of the novel and wondered why it ended with him, his anticipation of death told in Revelation terms. Was this meant to elevate him? To make this the lesson for all from the novel? Was it meant to say he had never changed? That it did say, but why end thus? Is even the end part of the mockery of his approach to life--mocking importance to a self important man? \n Another place that did not work for me was Rochester\'s narration of his past to Jane after the wedding has been called off. Mere telling went on way too long. \n I also could not believe that the feisty Jane could be almost persuaded by St John. Yes Bronte did try to make it believable by Jane\'s saying that she was docile and obedient until a certain level of resistance had been reached and then she would fight back. And as a child she had been excessively obedient, but then she had grown out of it. So I wasn\'t convinced that she remained in character. Of course, her being almost persuaded did add to the drama. It would have done so more had it been believable. \n In spite of features, which to me seemed faults, overall it was a good read.'),

Ronan is a Greywaren, just like his late father. He can procure things out from his dreams. But! - He\'s not the only Greywaren in town. Enter Joseph Kavinsky (Is he gay? I\'m so confused) who can do the same tricks and schemes as Ronan. He \"teaches\" Ronan how to control his dreams, but eventually, Ronan ditches him because well we all know that Ronan and Gansey are inseparable. \n Adam also has a little bit of tree conversing going on. In the last book, he sacrificed himself to Cabeswater so apparently he\'s like the \"eyes\" and \"hands\" (If I remember correctly??) of the whole place, which I think is pretty neat. In my opinion, Adam is the one who suffers deeply. He was abused by his father, lives his life working on 3 jobs, and he was rejected by Blue (ouch). I\'m not going to blame Blue, though. \n Speaking of Blue, nothing really much happened in her point of view in the story. (Maybe something will in the next book??) Looking back, I really wished something did. The only interesting parts was when she kissed Noah (Don\'t worry, he\'s dead) and was almost kissed by Gansey. Will Blue finally realize that Gansey may be the one who might die in her kiss? \n But hey, Kavinsky is not the only new character in The Dream Thieves ! Enter The Gray Man, a hit man who is certainly gray - from his hair to his clothes. His job throughout the whole book was to find the Greywaren. Only, he didn\'t know the Greywaren is a who . Along the way, he falls in love with Blue\'s mother, Maura! \n The only thing that is keeping me hanging is the disappearance of Maura at the end of the book.

I just finished it minutes ago and I want to review about what I thought about the book. \n First of all, the story is about Jacob Portman who grew up listening to his grandfather\'s stories, but then several years later as he grew up her began to not believe his \"fairy tales\" and treated him like everybody else. Though one day, his grandfather gets attacked by \"monsters\" and he tells Jacob to go to a woman named Miss Peregrine. He discovers the secrets his grandfather never told him before he died, and that the fairy tales are real -- and they are alive. \n The story was a mixed of the ordinary life and the strange life. For me, it was a bit dragging. The author just didn\'t go straight to the point. Jacob\'s character was not expressed well. I love all of the characters of this book, their talents and the fact that they are really peculiar. The book is rather dark and fun at the same time. The book only has 11 chapters and because of that I was getting bored. All in all, the book was splendid written, and peculiar. I suggest everyone to read this book \n OK, 11 months later, I can say that this book was not my cup of tea. The only interesting features about this book are the pictures, probably because there are a lot of YA books without pictures.

Her bravery isn\'t in-your-face-telling-not-showing, rather, it\'s very subtle and I loved that.

All I have to say about that is \'speak for yourself.\' I had no idea how to read this and I was barely getting along until I finally looked up a glossary and memorized a few of the more commonly used words. \n Besides the difficulty I faced in reading this book, I guess I just don\'t \"get it.\" The ultraviolence turned me off, which I guess was the point, however, I know a lot of people felt sorry for Alex and what he went through, well, not me. I\'m not saying he deserved everything he got, but he deserved a lot of it. He was a borderline psychopath who got off on violence and being an overall shitty human being. I have no sympathy for what he went through. I think what made me lose any and all compassion I might have had for him is when he (view spoiler)[ got two 10 year old girls drunk, brought them home, then raped them. (hide spoiler)] \n I don\'t get the theme warning about government control and whatever -- maybe they crossed the line but it\'s hard to care when the only example of that we\'re showed is what happened to Alex. \n Overall, I thought this book sucked. I almost gave up after page 20 but I powered through thinking about all the good reviews on goodreads. In hindsight, I should have just read wikipedia. This book was a real pain in the ass to read. If anyone wants to try and explain to me whatever I\'m not seeing, that\'d be nice. Can\'t say I\'d agree with you, though.'),

Maybe not to that extent but still none the less. I loved the suspense of trying to figure out the two mysteries. Once they were revealed, however, it was a bit of a let down.

Chaol still annoys me and my poor baby Dorian :(. I felt like this book dragged a bit but I think it\'s quite nice to actually read about training happening instead of just reading a sentence referring to a character\'s training and then the character being a BAMF right away.

Personally, I felt like the first half of the book was better than the second half. I\'m not quite sure that I understand Eleanor at the end but, oh well. I was able to read this book in about a day, give or take, so it\'s a pretty quick read. I didn\'t really feel anything at the ending, so I\'m not quite sure what the author was aiming for...maybe a bittersweet ending? But honestly, it didn\'t have to be. I\'m not saying it should have been a happily ever after thing, but I don\'t really agree with a character\'s actions in the end and I kind of feel like they acted that way just so the ending would be bittersweet. \n The romance got a little cliche and eye-roll inducing at times, when the author was being poetic or poignant but other than that it was pretty solid and cute. Also, if anyone could tell me whether or not they ever had sex, that\'d be great.

I know a bunch of people are raving in their reviews about this book about how maybe they got chills or something.

(794, 79, 49, 3, '*excuse my excessive use of the F-word in this review/rant/drabbleofthoughts* \n 3.5 stars. Okay. This book was a pretty solid 4 stars until the ending. I mean, if you read this book for what it is, you\'ll really enjoy it. What it is is a nice, easy, mindless, chick-lit book. It\'s a fast, easy read full of fluff and light teenage angst. So, I accepted that fact and I really enjoyed the book. The writing made me chuckle sometimes out loud but there were also times where I thought it was pretty cheesy (even for a chick-lit) and wondered if a guy really acted that way or would say that. Usually books with characters like these just annoy the crap out of me but somehow when Lauren Barnholdt writes them it\'s okay. Now, let\'s move on to the ending/my rant. Seriously, this book went from a solid 4 stars to 3/3.5 stars. I mean, I\'d give the ending itself 2 stars. Obviously I said not to expect much from this book but I seriously expected more than what it is. Let me explain. Jace and Peyton hook up for one day but it\'s this crazy, out of this world, amazing day. Then they talk and whatnot. Then one day, Jace stops talking to her, and therefore, breaks up with her (even though they technically weren\'t even dating). And it\'s like Jace and Peyton still aren\'t over each other *cue eye roll* and somehow they end up on this sorta, kinda road trip together. Oh, and you find out they broke up because of this \"secret\" that Peyton kept from Jace...prepare for the ranting (It will most definitely contain spoilers so...) (view spoiler)[ It turns out the \"secret\" that Peyton kept from Jace was that her parents were getting a divorce. (hide spoiler)] What. The. Actual. Fuck. Okay, here\'s where I have a problem with this book. I was willing to overlook the fact that Peyton and Jace are unrealistically obsessed with each other after one day but I will not overlook this. Like, SERIOUSLY? THAT\'S WHY HE WAS PISSED OFF AT HER? Are you fucking kidding me? Well, first off Jace, considering you guys only went on one date, it\'s no fucking wonder she didn\'t tell you (view spoiler)[ that her parents were getting a divorce (hide spoiler)]. She barely fucking knows you. She didn\'t even tell ANYONE yet, not even her best friend, or close family members, and you fucking expect her to tell you something that personal?! It obviously must devastate her. Why the fuck would you feel like she was obligated to tell you? It wasn\'t even a secret in a sense. It was her not ready to fucking share everything with you. That\'s so fucking stupid. If that was me I\'d tell the guy to fuck off. Not like I owe it to him to tell him something that\'s personal and none of his business, especially if I\'ve only known him for a few months. \n Also, Peyton was just so stupid. Why the fuck she didn\'t tell her dad, or anyone, that (view spoiler)[ her mom stole her identity (hide spoiler)] is beyond me. Yeah, I get it. that sucks. It was out of nowhere and how the hell do you confront a parent? But seriously, your dad is a fucking option! HELLO?! I mean, yeah, take some time to digest it but completely doing nothing about it and \"running away\" is just ridiculous. How old is she again? \n And Jordan giving that advice to Jace? Do teenage guys even think like that? And Jace and Peyton\'s povs sounded really similar. \n There are plenty more things to complain about but I think it\'ll just take all day. I gave Two-Way Street (a similar book by the same author) 5 stars because I read it years ago when I was much younger and my tastes were not yet as mature and refined as they are now (pfft hahahahahaha. yeah right. like I can actually use the words mature and refined to describe myself. Probably more accurate to say I\'ve slightly matured from pre-teen to young adult teen and therefore, now enjoy deeper reads.I still enjoy chick-lit every now and then though.), and the book was easy to read (I started and finished it on a Saturday morning) but I\'m pretty sure if I re-read it now the rating would go down. Still, if you read the book for what it is and aren\'t expecting anything above superficiality then you\'ll be able to enjoy the book. \n Plus there were a lot of things that didn\'t have closure. Also, why the heck even have B.J. in the book? And that scene with Jace\'s mom. Talk about cheesy and unrealistic. \n Also the cameos with Courtney and Jordan seemed to be there just so they would have a cameo in the book. Lame.'),

This book is charming (I think I\'m beginning to understand how a book can be described as \"charming\") and witty and made me laugh because of the writing.

(799, 80, 62, 1, '*Sigh* Boy, was I disappointed from this book...I was expecting this book to be amazing because it has a pretty high rating (honestly, I should have learned my lesson from TFiOS) and that some reviewers that I follow have praised and lauded Ms. Stiefvater\'s other books. So, I obviously expected this book to be amazing. I was wrong. It was boring, lackluster, and plain. First off, the pacing. Literally nothing, NOTHING, happens in this book. Oh you can argue with that point but whatever. I first realized that nothing happened at around page 100 when Puck had FINALLY decided to register in the race on her regular horse. It\'s ridiculous that it took that long. Why? Because it\'s unnecessary and BECAUSE IT\'S EXPLAINED IN THE SYNOPSIS. Ugh. Such a bad move. Then I read 300 more pages and I got near the end when finally, FINALLY, the race actually started. \n ...Are you kidding me? The WHOLE book is superficial and composed of NOTHING. Seriously!! I get it, the men discriminate against you, Puck, because you\'re a girl. I understood that concept the first time it happened. No need to shove it in my face every chapter. You and Sean have this crazy love for horses that no one else apparently understands. Gotcha. Oh yeah, and it\'s a BIG deal because you\'re the first/only girl to decide to do this. Yeah, I GOT THE MEMO. The idea that a girl takes the first initiative to end something that has long time been a male dominated activity used to be original but now it\'s become cliche, expected even! The author literally could have written this book in like 100 pages or less. Seriously. (Also, the reason that Puck joined the races is incredibly stupid and shallow. Seriously? It\'s not believable enough for me.) \n The author writes this book in alternating point of views. Puck and Sean. A.k.a. the female protagonist who is defying gender roles blah blah blah (not that that\'s not important but the way it was written was quite honestly, lame) and the male love interest (oh please, that\'s not even a spoiler. Seriously, did anyone NOT expect them to get together?) because you\'ve got to add a little romance in here *sarcasm*. My main complaint with this style choice is that the tone of the povs ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. Sean and Puck sound exactly.the.same. I shit you not, I\'m not even exaggerating or anything. I swear. Honest. I mean, if you\'re going to write multiple povs you HAVE to write them so they\'re different from one another (I think Rick Riordan is a GREAT example of this. His characters in the HoO series [while not all likable, at least to me] definitely all have unique voices. It\'s practically impossible to get them mixed up). Seriously, it\'s only two characters! You seriously couldn\'t create two different personalities? I mean, there\'s this one page where Sean remarks on how handsome this American guy is (another thing, the author created this world and decided to incorporate it somehow with reality. It\'s weird and awkward, at least for me). Do guys even do that?! \n I did enjoy the ending but it definitely DOES NOT make up for reading a whole book worth of nothing. The ending, while pleasing, isn\'t even surprising either. It\'s expected. Not good. \n This book unfortunately lacks originality. It falls into that young-adult-book category (I can\'t think of the word right now). Y\'know, when all young adult books seem to follow this pattern? Boy-meets-girl or vice versa and they bond and they get together at the end and everything works out happily ever after after stumbling over a few conflicts here or there.

So I had high expectations coming into this book and the beginning was kind of slow but I\'d say my expectations were surpassed. \n I was surprised to find out that this book had multiple povs, not just August (a.k.a. Auggie, our protagonist and main character). Those other povs turned out to be my favorite part of the book. It was a very clever addition that worked out because the other povs give us insight in how other people perceive August\'s facial deformities. It works so well because the author was spot on in her characterization of the characters. Their thoughts and their actions were 100% accurate/realistic and completely reflect how kids (and even adults) would act or think. Honestly, reading this transported me back to when I was in elementary school and I honestly emphasize so much. I was definitely one of those kids who didn\'t partake in bullying but I wouldn\'t stand up for the person either (I\'m ashamed to say). \n Kids and adults alike will enjoy this book and the message resonates no matter how old one may be. Everyone should be reminded of the message of this book and I genuinely think if I ever have a child/children I\'m going to give them this book to read. I honestly teared up like twice throughout this book, but I\'m a big sap, so. \n Also, the book I was reading had an extra \"Julian\" chapter and while I think it was a nice touch it wasn\'t as resonating or good as the main book imo, but maybe I\'m being too harsh.'),

If it comes down to him or Daenerys taking the throne I want Dany, all the way. (hide spoiler)]. Also, Daenerys was a BAMF (as usual), Jon Snow was actually interesting for once, Tyrion was witty as always, (view spoiler)[ apparently Arya can see again (hide spoiler)], the povs from non-main characters were actually well done and less boring, and there was no Sam and barely any Bran, so yay for that. I wished we caught up with Sansa. \n Again, though, I have doubts that George RR Martin can wrap up this series in 2 more books without it feeling rushed, cheap, or filled with a shit ton of plot holes. A large part is due to the snail\'s pace of the story. Seriously, after the first book it\'s been 4 books of gradual, slooooooowww buildup of the plot and we\'ve still yet to reach the climax.

(808, 81, 62, 2, '2.5 stars. \n There\'s a lot of sex and rape in this book, way more than in Game of Thrones from what I remember. The book started off pretty slow, the whole thing just felt like 1000 pages of set-up/filler with a very small foray into the introduction of magic, barely building upon what was introduced in GOT. The slow pacing of the book and the fact that it seemed like there were a lot of words but not a lot happening makes me want to just start watching the show, books be damned. Honestly, the only reason I\'m going to continue reading the series is the sole reason that it\'s GOT; if it were any other series I would just stop here. \n Also I felt like Tyrion had more than half of the povs in the book, definitely way more than any other character. Tyrion\'s a cool and interesting character but I was getting a little tired of reading through his povs because he just had so many.'),

Cersei\'s a bitch but we understand why she does what she does and to some extent, I respect her. Daenerys was the bad ass bitch I love, Tyrion is awesome as always, Jaime was more complicated than he originally appeared, Arya was awesome as always, Jon was cool as always, Catelyn was the bad ass mom she always is, Brann has exceedingly become boringer, and Sansa, well.

I was excited to read it because the cover was pretty cool and everyone was just raving about this book. Boy, was I disappointed. I don\'t even know where to start. Let\'s see, the plot was non-existent and was composed of Abby(protagonist) trying to resist irresistible, bad-boy Travis. It was completely pointless and stupid. Abby is attracted to him for nothing other than his supposedly good looks apparently. The characters were so fucking stupid (actually, the whole book was so fucking stupid.) Girls are attracted to Travis like moths are attracted to lights. They throw themselves at him without a second thought and I don\'t even understand why because the author doesn\'t explain it and just leaves it at Travis is hot, girls want to be with him because he\'s hot. He\'s not even likable. He\'s disgusting, he sleeps with any girl who throws herself at him, oh excuse me, he doesn\'t sleep with \"ugly\" girls apparently. Like, they legit just throw themselves at him! It\'s so unrealistic! And then of course Abby is the girl who changes his ways (cue exaggerated eye-roll). And Abby is the *only* girl who doesn\'t throw herself at him and doesn\'t want to sleep with him (spoiler: she actually does) and Travis is just dumbfounded and of course that means he has to find a way to get her to sleep with him. So Abby pretends she\'s resistant to his charm when she\'s not and is just playing hard to get just because. Like, she doesn\'t even have a reason. And then what\'s his face (I think it\'s Shep) and Amanda are just so f**king stupid. Shep defends Travis and it\'s so. I cannot even. UGH. This book. There are other reviews that explain it so much better. Travis isn\'t worth defending, he has no redeeming qualities and Abby is stupid and just ugh. All the characters in this book are so shallow, superficial and one-dimensional I just can\'t. Like, the biggest problem in their lives is relationships. Just...I can\'t believe people worship this book and they worship Travis. You people are the reason there\'s the misconception that girls only date \"bad-boys\". I can\'t believe any girl could condone his behavior. Really? REALLY? Faith in humanity=non-existent. \n Rant over. (for now)');

Some moments had me on the edge of my seat and I just HAD to read on to find out what happened. Also, me reading this close to Halloween means that I\'ve been reading/watching some scary stuff and since this book is like a mystery/thriller-ish there were some moments I would look around my room, paranoid. Strong debut if you ask me! \n Also this book was really focused on how Becca was struggling with leaving her small town and since I don\'t really live in a small town I couldn\'t exactly relate but it was still interesting to read nonetheless.

But the ending is still somewhat satisfying. \n Regina was hard to sympathize with; you feel bad for her, or at least I did, but you also kind of hate her. In a sense, she became a victim of her own abuse. Or as the saying goes, \"you reap what you sow.\" The book makes you think (when I say that I mean: it made me think), does Regina deserve what\'s happening to her? Does she deserve kindness? Personally, what does it say about me, that I enjoyed her petty revenges. That I was rooting for her to get back at Anna and Kara? That I was just as thrilled as she was at playing the same game as Anna and Kara, instead of being the bigger person? \n That being said, I didn\'t get into this book at first but after a while, I couldn\'t stop reading it. \n Also, what was up with the romance?

Day\'s pretty awesome too but I enjoyed June\'s povs more. I\'m also iffy about the romance -- it just didn\'t seem that organic/believable to me. Let\'s be real, it totally wasn\'t, but I\'m not saying I want slow burn, I just want something that cultivates after a little more time and experience spent together and a little more getting to know you, instead of the \"instant-attraction-I-don\'t-know-why-but-I\'m-just-drawn-to-you\" type thing. Thankfully the romance wasn\'t that big of a thing so it wasn\'t too bad. \n The beginning started off kind of slow (in my opinion) but, as everyone else says, the rest of the book is pretty fast paced and I didn\'t want to put it down. I agree with someone calling this book a little too formulaic, which is pretty true since that\'s what I thought when I finished the book. It follows the very tried and true (but still awesome) format of YA dystopian fiction. I\'m a little disappointed the book ended where it did -- I was kind of hoping more would happen but I know the author\'s saving that for the rest of the trilogy. \n I hope the 2nd and 3rd book are just as good as this book because honestly, YA dystopian trilogies have a tendency to have a kick ass first novel but then once the dystopian world has been established the 2nd and 3rd novel usually tend to take a completely different direction and end up being disappointing (*cough* looking at you Divergent trilogy *cough*). \n I\'m excited to read the next two books.

Alex\'s best friends are love-able but once she starts dating Cole you just want to strangle them! The book was pretty slow and didn\'t have much going for it, besides the abusive boyfriend plot, nothing interesting really happened. I\'d recommend this book for anyone who is interested in a young adult book about abusive relationships but only if you have nothing better to read. There are SO many other abusive relationship books that are 10x better. Honestly, I kind of wished that I hadn\'t read this because it was just such a step back from Hate List.

I admit, sometimes I start skimming through books. I tried to do it with this book. Big mistake. First, what was I thinking trying to skim parts of this? No. This book requires you to take your time and read it at the book\'s pace. You can\'t rush it. You have to read each and every word because every single word is important. But you will enjoy it immensely. The characters truly shine in this story. No matter how unlikable they are (or seem to be). I loved every. single. one. My favorites just might be Rudy and Ilsa(a.k.a the mayor\'s wife). Near the end of the book I started bawling. I was crying so hard. And I loved it. I loved that this book evoked that emotion out of me. In fact, I was so overwhelmed that I just had to put the book down and cry. I had to stop reading, put my head down, and just cry. I would then compose myself and start again - only to read the next sentence or two and just burst out in tears again. Part of it because the sentence made me cry.

It\'s pretty great and very fitting. \n It took a while to warm up to this book but I\'m very eager to start reading the second book! \n (Also, they\'re making a movie with Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley, and a bunch of other well known celebrity actors.

Okay, so let\'s start this review; first off, I loved how the author was able to have several different sub-plots going on at once with all the different characters and not have it all end up in confusion. She pulled it off, which is probably a hard thing to do, but she did it. That\'s not to say that I didn\'t have any issues with this book, because there were a lot. First off, it was pretty inconsistent now that I think about it. It\'s just the little things, like for example (view spoiler)[ Simon and Isabelle\'s relationship. Honestly, I thought they were already dating by the time this book started but no, they were still in the confusion zone of almost boyfriend and girlfriend, but not quite there yet. Really? Like, even at the end of the book, after all the intimate moments they shared, they\'re STILL not dating? And neither of them is apparently bright enough to figure out that they both love each other? Did the stuff that happened in the previous books not matter either? That\'s not to say that their relationship was probably the saving grace of this book for me... (hide spoiler)]. \n Also, the author uses the same adjectives/phrases for probably every character. Honestly, how many times do you need to tell us Jace is golden, or Sebastian has Valentine\'s hair and it suits him better than when he dyed it black? \n And Clary and Jace. Just,...really? REALLY? They were beyond annoying for most of this book, although there WERE some moments in which they were tolerable. Clary was SO selfish and their romance just resembles Edward\'s and Bella\'s from Twilight so much. \n Jace: I hurt you, I can\'t be with you anymore now, even though I love \n you and want to be with you! It\'s all my fault that you got hurt! (Mind you that I had this annoyance since the start of the series, surprisingly Jace wasn\'t the culprit in this book though!) \n Clary: I don\'t care if you want to die! I love you too much and i\'m so selfish that i\'m going to make everything worse! I\'m going to ignore what everyone tells me to do because I can\'t lose you; I love you so much that I can\'t live without you! (Really Clary? *sarcasm* How did you possibly survive before Jace came into your life? Clary was fine throughout the series but recently she\'s starting to annoy the crap out of me.) \n I have mixed feelings about how the author wrote about one couple or some group of characters and their adventure and then end the chapter on a cliffhanger. And then the next chapter...SURPRISE! starts right off with a different group of characters...like how she wrote about Simon and Isabelle and then suddenly alternates back to Jace and Clary...Although, at first I was incredibly annoyed, eventually I would warm up and start to get sucked into an adventure only to have the whole process repeat itself. \n But honestly, Isabelle and Simon...DAWWWW THEY\'RE SO CUTE!

The last paragraph itself is fine and kind of cute but the ending is where John Green just starts taking over and instead of the characters talking, it\'s just John Green talking to the reader to get across a philosophical, pretentious life theme. Seriously, like once Margo started spewing out stuff about paper towns and paper girls at the end I was gone and I didn\'t want to come back. I felt like Margo\'s characterization was choppy, and one could argue that\'s cause we see her from Q\'s point of view, but I blame it on poor execution.

In a book full of elegant scenarios and understated prose, the drama created in the climax felt out of place. The character\'s realizations and interactions were briefly overshadowed by the scenario that brought about their development. This didn\'t last for long though, and wrapped the story up well.

I loved it. \n While there are some plot points and characters that raised eyebrows for me (either for being overly tropey or perhaps not researched well enough) there was so much honesty and love in the crafting of this story that I felt connected to the characters and their struggles through the entire story. The author is able to do this despite basically telling the ending to the story on page one, which is pretty impressive. Definitely a study in creating suspense without withholding unnecessarily. \n I would particularly recommend this book for anyone who loves 80\'s movies, old video games, newer video games, or any part of geek culture.

(903, 88, 40, 3, '** spoiler alert ** \n This was one of the reads I was most looking forward to for 2016. As such, it\'s possible I let my own hype build up an impossible standard in my mind. I felt let down by this book, and incredulous at the majority of the plot turns. As a book about the interactions of a group of people dealing with different types of pain, this book is a success. As a book about the interactions of a group of people during a school shooting, this book fails to address the reality of that situation. \n The writing, especially on a sentence level, is strong. But often it seemed out of character or forced. For example, at one point in a flashback Tyler remarks that Claire is \'great with the underclassmen.\' Which sounds not at all like anything else he says and stood out as a decidedly out of character moment. Moments like that forced me to be less in the story, and thus more critical of the interactions. There were multiple times that the characters didn\'t use contractions or used snippets of Spanish that felt out of place that had the same affect on me: they pulled me out of the story. \n I love the amount of diversity, but at the same time...it doesn\'t make sense. Opportunity is supposed to be a small town, with limited emergency staff and hardware stores that are family run and operated. But somehow they attracted a strong group of immigrants? Why would these people move to Opportunity? We\'re never shown or even have it hinted at as to why Opportunity is so ethnically diverse when for the most part small towns in the south aren\'t. Though the lack of background might seem small, I think it hints at a larger problem. One where the characters lack in depth. Sure. Not knowing what Tomas and Sylvia\'s parents do for a living doesn\'t really impede my understanding of their tragedies, but it does make them feel thin as characters. I wanted to know things like where they did pick up Spanish, were their parents recent immigrants, why did they not get along before, why do they get along now? \n Despite the apparent abundance of diverse characters, there are a few glaring areas of oversight. At the time of the shooting, the students are in an auditorium. It\'s plot relevant that no one is outside the auditorium except for a couple of boys in the principal\'s office. \n This would never happen. Usually there are a few students with special needs who can\'t abide the auditorium who are in a pull out classroom, along with special ed teachers and aids. But I guess Opportunity doesn\'t have a very large special education community? Likewise, the school nurse usually waits in his or her office in the event someone becomes sick, and there are numerous faculty and administration who don\'t attend events in the auditorium because phones still need to be answered, hallways still have to be monitored, etc. \n Tyler feels particularly thin as a character. And the added \'rape\' felt forced. it felt less like a plot turn and more like \"oh yeah, he\'s evil. We get it.\" It\'s like watching that little shit Joffrey torture people on Game of Thrones. The first one is important and shocking, but around the fifth I just have to wonder why we have to see all of them. Why does Tyler have to do every evil thing? It would have been more shocking to see Tyler not be evil in some other aspect of his life and yet still be evil. \n Many of the details surrounding the actual shooting are incorrect, and especially as the novel progressed things seemed increasingly poorly researched. Given the number of shootings in America at this time and thus the number of shooting survivors at this time, that seemed like an egregious fault. it\'s not hard to find detailed accounts of what it feels like to have a bullet in you. \"pain washed over me\" hardly begins to cover it. Likewise, I felt grossed out by the characters who felt crush-like romantic feelings during the shooting. \n Overall, this wasn\'t a bad book. I really can\'t wait for this writer to write something else. She obviously is talented, but this book doesn\'t live up to that promise.'),

Lyra is a remarkable protagonist with who is a perfect blend of flaws and strengths, and her relationship with her daemon, Pan, is so realistic and comforting that every time I stopped reading I kept looking for my own daemon. \n Pullman blends fantastical elements with mundane ones expertly, and even when we\'re being taken to lands with talking polar bears, everything is presented so authoritatively that it feels true rather than real. The characters are complicated, the morality is full of greyscale, and none of the decisions are easy, for the characters or for the readers. \n And that\'s why it\'s important. \n In fantasy, we often rely on good and evil being very black and white concepts, but to actively play with these constructs and show that that\'s all they are, constructs, is brilliant. In Pullman\'s world, self-knowledge is king, and the only true evil is to deny your own nature. \n So, great fantasy series? Or greatEST fantasy series?'),

I recommend it highly. This was a period of history I knew nothing about before reading these books, and I plan on binge reading every wikipedia page even tangentially related and then rereading the books.

Fantastic character development across the board. This book gives us more insight into all of our favorite raven boys, and Blue. Some reviewers said they felt like there wasn\'t enough Blue in this story, but I couldn\'t disagree more. If anything, in this novel I really felt like it was easy to see the way Blue really affects (and improves) the group dynamic. Blue\'s exchanges with Noah are particularly worth paying attention to if you are Blue fan (who isn\'t? Great female lead). \n The only reason I\'m giving four stars instead of five is because I felt like there wasn\'t enough development of the Glendower plot arc, and because, like many middle books in series, it seemed a tad \'mushy\' in places. It doesn\'t have a proper beginning or conclusion on its own. You will be left with more questions than answers, and that\'s just how middle books are. \n I can\'t wait till the next book comes out.

Bray does address many of the issues facing women in society well, and clearly has a nuanced view of these issues. \n Overall: This book works well as social commentary (and I agree with its points and think they need to be made), but unfortunately the commentary comes at the expense of plot which feels like a tack on designed to get the characters where they need to be to make the next \"point\". \n Totally worth a read. \n Probably not worth a second read.'),

We\'re reminded every few pages that Tris is \'slim\' and that\'s what makes her strength so exciting.

The book centers around the Peter Pan story that we all know and love, but centers around the character of Tiger Lily, and is told from the perspective of Tinkerbell. \n Pros: \n The ending of this book is what saved it for me. If I ever have a daughter, I will make sure that she reads this book early and often. Tiger Lily is a strong character, and the ending of the book is much closer to what romantic love is than most of the young adult novels that I read. In the end, you can love someone and not get to have them. I say that, but the novel was also able to avoid becoming preachy. A tough line to walk, and one that I feel earns the author quite a bit of credit in my eyes. \n Tik Tok\'s character and relationship with Tiger Lily is also phenomenal. Every exchange between the two of them was emotional and even handed. \n Cons: \n Action sequences have a tendency to get muddy and convoluted. \n Narrating a book about Tiger Lily through the perspective of Tinkerbell gets messy in some places. There are clearly places where the author wanted to include thoughts and feelings, but had to go through the narrator instead, removing us from them by a strange narrative degree. \n Overall: Would recommend.

Out of all of the books this one seemed the most obsessed with the romance between the characters and less on the action, and given how integral this one is to the story arcs, that seems like a serious mistake. \n Some of my major grievances are that the characters seem to care about their romances above all else. Towards the end of the book Alec is described as looking more relaxed as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Why? Because he could finally talk about his relationship with his parents. Ignoring the fact that Alec has been a responsible and caring character for the previous two books, I find it strange that this is the most important thing to him by the end of the novel and NOT THE FACT THAT HIS LITTLE BROTHER DIED during the few days he was supposed to be taking care of his younger siblings. \n Likewise Isabelle, who does have a legitimate emotional reaction to the death of her sibling, is giggling and talking about boys with Maia. \n Every single character seems to believe that their romantic entanglements are the things that most define them, and seem more interested in figuring out those than in figuring out the world around them. \n That said, I\'ll definitely read the next two. Why? Because the action is well written, the world is fascinating, and the characters (when they\'re not obsessing over who they are going to kiss) are fairly engaging.

Shot trying to stop him, Valerie inadvertently saved the life of a classmate, but was implicated in the shootings because of the list she helped create. A list of people and things she and Nick hated. The list he used to pick his targets. \n Now, after a summer of seclusion, Val is forced to confront her guilt as she returns to school to complete her senior year. Haunted by the memory of the boyfriend she still loves and navigating rocky relationships with her family, former friends and the girl whose life she saved, Val must come to grips with the tragedy that took place and her role in it, in order to make amends and move on with her life. \n Valerie Leftman has an unusual plight. She is both a hero and a villain to the people who made her life a living hell for the past three years. She is a hero for ending the shooting spree that took the lives of several of her classmates and at least one teacher. She\'s a villain for possibly being the one that started the violence in the first place. \n Valerie loved Nick so much that she ignored the many warning signs that indicated that something was horribly wrong in his head and instead played into the delusions that united them and eventually led Nick to kill himself after trying to shoot everyone who had ever hurt Valerie. This leaves her to deal with the introspection, and confusion that everyone feels following the shooting. Valerie deals with reporters, her family, and the kids at school, none of whom seem entirely sure of what to think of her anymore, and honestly neither can the reader. It\'s up to the reader, ultimately, whether Valerie is guilty or not. As many other characters say, she never did shoot anyone, but she did make the outline of who should be. \n Valerie learns a lot through her last year. Without Nick to shield her or allow her to fall into her own world, Valerie has to live in the real world and her perception grows and expands in order to fit that. \n Told through both Valerie\'s own words and the newspaper articles, Hate List is a story about bullying, love, and tolerance. More than that, it\'s the story of a girl struggling through hurt and loss while all eyes are on her, judging and evaluating her every move. \n The pacing of Hate List was very good, and while it\'s a remarkably difficult topic it was handled with the right mix of respect and honesty. The story Jennifer Brown has laid out for us is full of unexpected turns, Valerie\'s memories of Nick are some of the most beautiful and disturbing chapters. Brown forces us to deal with the reality that Nick wasn\'t a monster, and that the victims aren\'t saints through Valerie\'s eyes. Hate List is probably the first book I have ever read about a school shooting that didn\'t get thrown across the room, and that\'s a significant accomplishment. Hate List avoids the realm of preachiness that many other \'issue\' books fall into, and instead focuses on telling the story, the true story, of a school on the mend.'),

There was nothing in this book that stood out to me or was particularly interesting in any way. The premise obiously takes place during Christmas, and the main character\'s family owned a Christmas Tree farm, but overall, this book didn\'t even put me in the Christmas spirit or have any heartwarming moments. Even the scandal and drama that was supposed to surround the love interest was really dull. I didn\'t feel like there was ever any actual conflict in this book--everything that happened that could have potentially caused conflict was resolved within chapters in a completely matter of fact way. The dialouge between characters in this book was bland as well, and completley unrealistic. I also felt like the author needed to do a lot more research on several things, and a lot of things that were thrown in were just completely unrealistic. Our main character leaves school from thanksgiving to christmas, and her teachers are just ok with it because they are used to it happening. What about finals?

Each queen is then sent to live with others of their gift until they turn sixteen years old, when they then fight to the death to determine who will be the one true queen. I was really happy that we got to see from each of the queens perspectives in this book, but I also thought that we got too many different perspectives from side characters. It was overwhelming and confusing at times and I would have prefered it to just have been the three queens. I also went into this thinking that we were actually going to get to see the fight, but majority of the book takes place before they turn sixteen.

Set in a futuristic America, the violent crimes people commit have left shadows, and those shadows are turning into monsters.

And mass murders--bombings, terrorist attacks, school shootings--produce the Sunai, the rarest breed of monster that use songs to steal souls. \n The city of Verity is split into two.

Kate Harker, daughter of the head of the North side of the city, who is fighting her way back to her father, to prove that she has what it takes to live among the monsters. And August Flynn, Sunai, who wants more than anything else to human. \n This book had great characters (especially August who needs to be protected at all costs), beautiful writing, and amazing story building and plot. I am very interested to see how the follow-up, Our Dark Duet, stands in comparison to this book, as it is set to pick up six months after the events of this book leave off.

This book is beautifully diverse and tackles important issues with with deft and grace. \n My favorite part of this book was the way that it was written. Not only to you get to bounce between Daniel, a poet who is obsessed with love, and Natash, a scientist that doesnt even believe in it-- but we get background stories for character\'s we meet in passing, histories of people and events, and scientific explanations of abstract concepts. The way Yoon manages to weave all of the parts of this story together is magical. Not to mention her prose is pure poetry. \n I did have a couple small problems with this book. For whatever reason, I found some parts in the middle dragged a bit, and it was hard for me to push through. I think it may be the fact that I\'m not a huge fan of stories that are told in the span of one day. Things move too fast for me and I have a hard time suspending my disbelief that so much could happen and characters could go through so much development in such little time. That being said, I did find Daniel kind of intense and overbearing at some points, because he was so gung ho for love in such a short amount of time. However, this book also did a really good job of addressing that and being really self aware, so it was only a very minor issue, which is why I rounded up to five stars. \n If you have not read anything by Nicola Yoon yet I would highly recommend her work.

The problem was, while I liked the fact that the characters were diverse, I didn\'t actually like the characters. I didn\'t hate them, I just didn\'t really care about them or feel any attachment to them what so ever. I think the main problem with this book is that there are WAY too many subplots. The author tries to cram every relevant issue today into this book. While a school shooting is going on, characters are also dealing with abuse, rape, and other family issues. There\'s too much going on for you to care about all of it or for it to feel like the characters care about all of it, so instead you care about none of it. I was also hopeful because I had heard that the author did a lot of research before writing this, so I expected it to be very accurate to real events, but based only off of my first-hand experience in the public school system, I could tell that it wasn\'t. It might have been a realistic portrayal of something that would happen 10 years ago, but not now, after our country has experienced events like this time and time again. My biggest problem was when the shots first started and the coach outside had no idea what to do. Teachers have lock down procedure drilled into them and they would always have some procedure for kids to follow in any situation. I also thought that the social media sections were a huge disappointment. It could have been done so well but it all felt so fake and nothing like what actual teenagers would write on twitter. I just think this book should have been gone about in an entirely different way, and overall it left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.'),

It wasn\'t predictable at all, I was constantly surprised by what would happen next as I read. I picked this book up on a whim to try something different and I am so glad that I did!'),

I thought it introduced a lot of great new characters and did a much better just showing instead of telling (which was my biggest problem with the first one). While I really enjoyed the first 100 pages after that I thought the plot slowed down a lot and I started to really lose interest. That\'s what really brought down the rating for me. I will say though that this is still one of the most original YA series I have ever read.'),

It was definitly creepier and more graphic, but I thought that it did a great job of explaining all of the shit that went down in the first two books.

I missed not having our cast of characters around that I had grown to love so much in Hollow City, because they really make the story for me. Emma and Jacob on their own were pretty boring to read about. I also felt like the pacing was super off--the first half didn\'t really have anything happening and by the time the action started picking up I was disinterested and it was really hard for me to get back into the story. I also wasn\'t a huge fan of the ending. Jacob\'s parents was very annoying to me and I kind of wish that he didn\'t return home at all. Overall I did enjoy this series and thought it was unique but I just wasn\'t a huge fan of this conclusion.'),

I wasn\'t sure if it was becuase I already knew the information or if it was the writing itself, but I adored this second installment, so my doubts have been vanished. \n The second book picks up right where we left off in the first. I was really hoping that we would get to explore more loops in this book because that concept is so interesting to me and I was not disspointed. Ransom Riggs continued to use vintage photographs to further this story and take it to interesting and original places. Reading these books is a lot like reading Harry Potter for me. I love all of the children so much and I love the innocence that they bring to the story as they naviagte these pecular places and people while facing dangers that ordinary children would be unable to face.

I just feel really strongly that this book did nothing for the series. I obviously haven\'t continued on with the third book yet, but I feel like this series would have been better as a duology. \n It was such a disappointment for me because I loved the first book so much, but this was a major second book slump. I love the characters and the world, but I just could not find it in me to care about the plot in this installment. I really really wanted to, there was just nothing for me to latch onto. \n I still want to finish up this series and give it one more chance, because I think it deserves that, but I plan on waiting a little while before I continue on to try and un-slump myself.'),

I thought they were extremely well written and I thought each one was equally captivating in its own way, but they all built off of each other to tell one story. \n The hardest part of reading Heir of Fire for me was seeing Celaena so broken and depressed. I loved reading these novellas because we got to see more of the old fiery, sarcastic Celaena, who I love reading about. It was so hard getting to know Sam because I shipped him and Celaena so much even though I knew it wasn\'t going to end well. I\'m really glad I read these before starting Queen of Shadows because I learned a lot about Arobynn and what an ass he is, and he is going to be an important part of Queen of Shadows, so now I am really looking forward to that confrontation and for Celaena to (hopefully) get her revenge.'),

A lot of this book is worldbuilding and being introduced to all of the characters, and the movie did a really good job of sticking to the book for the most part, so it was a lot of reading things that I already knew, and I think that it made it a little boring for me. I also found myself not liking certain characters while reading as much as I liked them in the movie. However, I could have had a completely different reaction had I read the book first, so that\'s why I feel like I can\'t be completely fair in this review. I would have rated the book three stars, and the movie five, so I settled on a four star rating.

And I did enjoy this book and I think this series is going promising places, but there are definitely some obvious ways that Bardugo\'s writing has improved from this book to now. \n My biggest problem with this book was that I felt like it was all telling and no showing. I love the world of Grisha and I thought this book had a really good plot, but there would be whole paragraphs that would literally just describe big chunks of time and events that happened, instead of showing us those events. It was a lot of narrations where I felt like she could have made more scenes and dialogue. I feel like this also led me to not care about the characters as much because they didn\'t have enough interactions that we got to see, and when I don\'t care about the characters, I\'m just not that interested in the story. \n I also think that maybe I could have enjoyed this more if I had read it before Six of Crows. Since I was already acquainted with the whole Grisha magic system--which I loved reading about in Six of Crows-- I feel like it took some of the novelty of the discovery of the world that happens in the first book in a series.

I thought the character development was amazing and all the characters were portrayed as very realistic. I loved the plot and the list and all of the different friendship dynamics in this book as well. I\'m also really happy that the whole Sloane mystery was actually solved in the end because I was worried we would never get to know what really happened, so I liked that aspect of the ending. I read Amy and Roger\'s Epic Detour last summer and I thought it was a fun read, but I definitely enjoyed this one a lot more. I do really like Morgan Matson\'s writing style and I thought it was so cool to see her continue adding playlists as a part of her books.

I thought this book had a great amount of action for a second book and it had its own plot that I really really enjoyed--no second book syndrome at all! Can I just say that I felt really bad for Mare during this book? I felt like everyone was being so unfair and cruel to her. Throughout the book I really empathized with her and I didn\'t think that anything she did was as bad as anyone made it out to be? She was a little power hungry but I felt that after everything she went through in book one she had a right to want to feel powerful and in control of her life. And yeah, she didn\'t trust anyone but if I went through what she went through, I wouldn\'t either! I honestly hated Farley at the end of this book I couldn\'t believe she would act that way to Mare when it was her own brother who died. When Shade died I felt a knife go through my back as well. I had to pause and take deep breaths. He was the only person besides Mare that I trusted throughout this entire book, so of course he had to die. I was living for the sweet moments between Mare and Cal, they made me so happy. I just wished there would have been a lot more of them! This series is super light on romance, to the point that we don\'t even get any makeout scenes between the characters, only quick kisses and thigh rubbing, which is great, but I need more. I guess it\'s probably a lot more realistic given that they\'re in a life or death situation and that\'s probably the last thing they\'re thinking about, but come on, we don\'t read these types of books because they\'re realistic. When I read Red Queen, I had a gut feeling that Maven was going to betray her, so that book didn\'t have as big of a plot twist for me, but I completely did not see this ending coming. It seemed so plausible that they would to the war for the last book I could see it playing out in my head already so I was SHOCKED.

I love so many characters in these books and it I\'m constantly terrified for them because of how brutal Tahir\'s world is. I loved that this book dealt more with magic and magical creatures and I would love for the next book to go even deeper with that.

I don\'t understand the reason the aliens invaded. When I started this book I was really hoping for a big scene where we got a detailed explanation of things and that just didn\'t happen. Now, I don\'t know if this is because I was too stupid to jump to a conclusion I was supposed to have jumped to, or if it was never really explained at all, but if someone could tell me I would love to discuss this one with someone to gain a better understanding.

The only reservation I have is that I\'m not really a fan of any of the characters yet. They\'re ok, but many times as I was reading I found them annoying and I can\'t say I\'ve grown attached to any of them yet.

The only problem I had with this book is that I felt like a lot of the plot was very obvious. I kept expecting there to be a really dramatic plot twist, but everything that happened I saw coming from the beginning.

I enjoyed a lot of aspects about the book, but it didn\'t hold my attention, and I felt like I had maybe read it at the wrong time. Recently with the release of Wayfarer I was feeling nostalgic for this story and I decided to give it another go. This time around, I throughly enjoyed it. I was able to fully engross myself in the story this time and parts that I found confusing before I now understood because I remembered it from the first read through. This is one of the things that I love most about reading and stories in general. They mean different things to everyone who reads them, and are so influenced by where we are in reality while we are reading them. I love that I can come back to a story a year later and take away completely different things than I did before. \n 2/20/16 \n This is a difficult review for me to write because I\'m not sure why I didn\'t particularly love the book. I thought the writing was great, and I really enjoyed the diversity in the book and the places they traveled to were very intriguing to me. I thought that the first 100 pages or so could have been trimmed down significantly. It was very hard to follow what was going on in the beginning and I think that it was mostly because of the dual POV. I could follow Etta\'s chapters but I thought Nicholas\'s were unnecessary and confusing because they focused only on past information we knew nothing about, and I think we could have just been presented with that information later when we had a better understanding of what was going on. Once they started traveling I became more excited but for some reason, I still just couldn\'t get into it. I think it may just be a personal preference, because so many people have raved about this book. There was nothing necessarily wrong with it I just personally found it a bit boring.'),

Usually when I read stand-alone fantasy\'s I feel like there\'s not enough world building or character building but I didn\'t feel that with this book at all. The only thing I think could have been done better was developing the romance in the book. The main character actually spent very little time with the love interest in this book, and most of the book was devoted to her and her relationships with the other Siren\'s and the ocean. I liked the other Sirens, I just felt like all of those plot points weren\'t really what the main idea of the book was about, and so it kind of felt like needless information, and she barely ended up spending any time with the guy she was in love with.

A lot of what I thought was \"bad writing\" ended up being the foundation for plot twists that I mistook for plot holes at the time. I trusted characters that I knew I shouldn\'t have trusted, and when their betrayal came, it still broke my heart. For the last 100 pages of this book, I was completely immersed and could not put the book down. Mare Barrow is a complete badass and I love her for it.

Most people that have read and enjoyed Vampire Academy and Bloodlines will tell you that the series only gets better after the first book--and I completely agree. I think that aspect of Mead\'s writing style is reflected in this book as well. The Glittering Court is technically a \"series\", but in reality, it\'s the same story being told three times from different perspectives, so the book actually reads as a stand alone. I think that\'s why I found the first half so boring. A lot needed to be set up so that the second half could wrap itself up, and once the foundations were laid and the character relationships were built, the book was AMAZING. However, a lot of aspects about the first half did annoy me. Adelaide and Tamsin could both be very pretentious and annoying at times, and a lot of \"issues\" they faced--like what colors they were dressed in or the decorations for events-- I didn\'t really care about. But by the second half of the book, Adelaide felt like a completely different character, and I loved her, so it ended up being great character development on Mead\'s part. I am excited to read the other two books and learn more about the other characters, but I really, really wish this series would have just followed Adelaide and Cedric\'s story because I ended up loving them so much by the end of the story and I feel like if their story continued I probably would\'ve ended up loving it as much as bloodlines.'),

Absolutely stunningly beautiful writing. \n The End of Love; Nina Lacour: 4 Stars- Very cute with very likable, realistic characters. \n Last Stand at the Cinegore; Libba Bray: 5 Stars- This one was epic.

Stephanie Perkins never disappoints. \n Souvenirs; Tim Federle: 4 Stars- Very cute with well-written characters. I really liked the themes brought up in this one. \n Inertia; Veronica Roth: 5 Stars- Such a cool concept that was well-written and beautifully sad. The underlying issues regarding mental health were so heartbreaking but also so important to write about. \n Love is the Last Resort; Jon Skovron: 4 Stars- I started out LOVING this one, and it gave me a very Jane the Virgin feel with the narration. I loved the setting and the characters, but as the story went on the dialogue really got on my nerves--it was super unrealistic. \n Good Luck and Farewell; Brandy Colbert: 5 Stars- This one made me cry. Maybe it\'s because I\'m from Chicago, and the contents of this story felt all the more real to me, but this story was just beautiful. Absolute perfection. \n Brand New Attraction; Cassandra Clare: 5 Stars- This was my most anticipated story of the collection, and it did not disappoint! It was so awesome to see Cassandra Clare\'s amazing writing in a setting that was different than her shadowhunter novels. \n A Thousand Ways This Could All Go Wrong; Jennifer E. Smith: 4 Stars- This story was very cute while also managing to deal with a very important yet rarely talked about subject matter, and I loved that. \n The Map of Tiny Perfect Things; Lev Grossman: 5 Stars- The perfect bookend to wrap up this anthology.

I went into this book sceptical about the plot, but I had good faith because it had so many positive reviews.

Our main character, Yael, is a Jewish concentration camp survivor. As a child in these camps, she became part of the eugenics experiements the Nazi\'s conducted. As an unforseen side effect of these experiements, Yael gains the abillity to change her appearance at will. The story alternates between Yael\'s past story in the camp and Yael\'s current mission: to win a deadly motorcycle race and kill Hitler. \n I\'ll start by saying that I loved the timeline set in the past. I found the premise of her gaining her ability fascinating and the stories of the people she left behind heartbreaking. When I was reading these chapters I could not put the book down. \n However, I wish she would have executed the current time-line very differently. Part of the reason I was skeptical about this book was I found the premise of a motorcycle race with the reward of a ball in your honor thrown by Hitler very cheesey. I wanted to give it a try and I hoped that it would prove me wrong, but I was not able to get into it at all. I just felt that these parts were written so flatly, and I was completley bored while reading them. I couldn\'t get into any of the characters at all, which is interesting to me because I was able to do so in the chapters told in flashbacks. \n Apart from being just a generally flat character, I was constanly frustrated by the choices that Yael would make. She was supposed to be trained to be the best chance the rebellion had at killing Hitler, yet every mistake she made was so stupid and easliy aviodable, and then she would still be surprised when she was caught or challenged. \n I\'m not sure what the plot of the second book is entirely, but I don\'t think I will continue on with this series.'),

(980, 95, 32, 5, 'I have very weird feelings about this book right now, and I wasn\'t sure if I was going to write a review. I started out absolutely loving this book and every single character, but as I read more and more, I think I liked it less and less? I\'m not sure if that\'s really how I feel or if it was just a lot of reading in a short amount of time, but I didn\'t finish this book feeling like I usually do after finishing a Cassandra Clare book. At first I loved every single character so much, but (super unpopular opinion) I don\'t like Mark at all. I completely sympathize with what he\'s gone through and I feel bad for the guy, but he made me so angry and reading from his POV was so boring and made me madder. As I read, I decided I just really really loved Julien and he DOES NOT get enough recognition and love and people give him such a hard time for the dumbest reasons and I will defend him until I die. I liked that in this book our main character was a Shadowhunter already so we didn\'t have to go through the whole explanation and discovery of the shadow world again because it would have been so repetitive for me at this point. However, I think the main reason I wasn\'t as captivated with this book was because I didn\'t like the plot line and the villain as much as I like the plot lines in her other novels. I thought it was very interesting, but it moved way too slowly to the point where I was really just reading for the character relationships and not the plot at all. I couldn\'t believe that the mystery of Emma\'s parents deaths was solved in book one! That just felt so anticlimactic and simple to me considering that is the conflict our main character starts the story with. I do think the ending was very promising and will create a good conflict for our main characters for the rest of the series. I did really really enjoy the book, anything Cassie writes is amazing no matter what and I cannot wait for book two!'),
(981, 95, 27, 4, 'I\'ve seen a lot of mixed opinions about The Heir and The Crown, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed reading this one! Much like the first three books, The Heir was a simple and fluffy read, but one that was still very entertaining. \n I know a lot of people dislike this book because of the main character but I honestly really liked her. I found her flawed but still very relatable. She definitely has her problems but I think in YA we get a lot of these seemingly perfect female protagonists and I think it was really nice and refreshing to see a protagonist who is flawed but still has the potential to go through a lot of character growth. I also think that a lot of aspects of her personality make complete sense considering her background. \n I liked getting a different perspective of the selection in this book as well. Getting to know all of the boys made this a really fun read for me. At this point, I have no idea who she will choose to be with in the end (if anyone) and I like that about this book as well. Reading the selection you can pretty much tell who America will end up with from the beginning and I like that with this book it will be more of a surprise.'),
(982, 95, 52, 4, 'This book made me very emotional. I\'m still trying to process the fact that it\'s over, because I had thought going into this book that The Heir was a continuation of America\'s story, but I didn\'t find out that it was really a different story until I finished the book. I thought I had so much more time with these characters! They\'ll still be in The Heir obviously but it won\'t be the same. \n The one thing that really shocked me about this book was the amount of character death! The first two books didn\'t have any deaths at all so I definitely fell into a false sense of security there! I\'m really glad Cass ended up putting the deaths in though because some of the problems I had with the first two books were that they were too fluffy. I never felt like the characters were in any real danger, and I think it made the plot and the causes the characters fought for a lot more valid! I was also really happy with the way the romances ended up as well. I won\'t give anything away, but there were no loose ends there. My favorite part about the book was the way the girls all ended up coming together and working out their differences. I loved how they were able to end the drama and have each others backs. Overall I thought this book did a great job of wrapping things up in a way that satisfied the reader but was still a little bittersweet. I\'m really curious to see what The Heir will end up being about now!'),

The was such a lighthearted, fun series to read and I\'m so glad that it ended in a tone to match. I thought the character development was great as well. I was a bit worried as to how everything would wrap up in an entertaining way because this book was so short but there were some great twists that I didn\'t expect. The only thing I think there could have been more of would have been romance, and I definitely think it could have been longer just to give us more scenes that focused on character relationships and fleshing things out more.'),
(984, 95, 97, 4, 'Reading this book, at first, seemed very tedious to me. I wanted a decision from the main character so badly, and was so angry that she couldn\'t seem to make up her mind about anything and when she did make up her mind she changed it a day later. But really I think that I just really sympathize for the situation she is in. I don\'t focus on as many of the smaller details as she does, but I\'m not sure what I want for her in the long run. I personally prefer Aspen over Maxon and think it would be great if she just waited out his military service and lived a nice quiet life as a two since she hates being in the spotlight. However, I want her to become queen not because I want her to necessarily be with Maxon, but because I want her to be able to use her power as Queen to fix their broken society because she has the courage and passion to do it!'),

(986, 95, 50, 5, '** spoiler alert ** \n I was determined to give this book 4 starts up until the very end. But I love this series and the ending too much to do it (even though it\'s probably 4.5 stars in my opinion). \n I just struggled so hard with the beginning of this book. I\'ll admit, I had very high expectations because The Wrath and The Dawn was literal perfection, but I just found the first half of this book so . . . boring. Renee Ahdieh will also hold the award for most beautiful writing ever, but the beginning of this book was so dragged out and oversimplified to me. I felt like ultimately the characters overcame every obstacle in this book way too easily. Artan told Shazi that his aunt would eat her alive, and when they went to visit her, everything was fine. I expected her to at least trick or lie to them, but no. I even half expected the Magus to betray them because everything at that point seemed suspiciously easy to me. Shazi\'s magic lessons in the middle of the book seemed overall pointless to me as well. Nothing ever really came of it because I still think in the end Shazi could have come to the conclusion with the chains on her own like she did with the carpet. All that these scenes really added to the book was length. And then they needed to destroy the book, and they did. Even Shazi\'s escape from Salim seemed relatively easy. \n Also Tariq PISSED ME OFF TO NO END. \n I did appreciate Despina\'s story line immensely though. That completely surprised me. Overall I was very happy with the ending of this book and it gave me all the feels so five stars it is. Still overall this was a beautiful duology.'),

It might just be me-- I don\'t know if I\'ve ever read a stand-alone dystopian book that I really got into. I prefer the character growth over the span of a series. But I liked the concept of the book and the characters, I just think you can always do so much more with the story if you have more books to work with.'),

I could feel myself slipping into a reading slump and I\'m so thankful I picked this book up when I did because it managed to engage me like no other book I\'ve read in a seriously long time. The best thing about this book is that it\'s so completely unique and different than anything I\'ve ever read. Usually, I\'m always drawing connections in my mind between books while I\'m reading but this book really created a world of its own. I had absolutely no idea where the plot was headed or how things would resolve and I didn\'t see any of the plot twists coming, which is really rare for me because I\'ve found that lately I usually always can tell where books are headed and see the plot twists coming before the main character. Despite the very dark tone of this book, Sabaa Tahir\'s writing style is so elegant and the themes and characters in this book were so beautiful.'),
(989, 95, 95, 3, 'I don\'t know why it\'s so surprising to me, but every few chapters or so I would find myself completely blown away by Yancey\'s writing. His word choice and sentence structure are absolutely breathtaking. I think that\'s the one thing that really makes these books stand out to me. Instead of just writing a book about fighting aliens, Yancy has created a book that questions the essence of humanity and the meaning of hope. That\'s definitely what I like the most about these books. \n The only thing I do not like is that sometimes the writing is so poetic and beautiful that the action can be hard to follow. There were times when I would be reading and I would have to double back and carefully reread something I had missed to find out what was going on, because of the writing style, and even now I\'m a little unclear on some things. The other problem I had with this book specifically is that it took a REALLY long time to get into the action. I did really enjoy the book, especially the second half. \n I love the authenticity of Yancey\'s characters. Even though the book takes place in a post-apocalyptic environment, I still feel like the characters all act like people I could meet in real life. There\'s nothing worse than reading a young adult book where the characters don\'t act like teenagers would actually act, but Yancey hits the nail right on the head.'),
(990, 95, 73, 5, 'Oh my God. This book has so much hype and I was so excited for it and yet it still exceeded my expectations. Everything about this story was absolutely brilliant. I loved the fact that this story was told in four different perspectives, and the way she opened with each story connecting was amazing. I loved it because she chose to have each character come from a different country, and therefore tell a different part of the complex story that is World War II. The thing I love most about Sepetys as a historical fiction writer is that she always tells the stories that aren\'t well known. As an American, I grew up learning that the Germans were bad and the Soviets invaded and saved the Jews and liberated everyone. While Germany obviously played an awful part in the war, the Soviets were just as bad, and Sepetys brings this to light. It was so interesting that the characters were actually seeking refuge in Germany. The writing in the book was so beautiful and it brought me to tears quite a few times. I loved the connection to Between Shades of Gray as well! This book I think was more graphic in nature than Between Shades of Gray, but I think that it needed to be in order to tell the important but forgotten story of all of the people that lost their lives in this part of the war. Is it too soon to start waiting for Ruta Sepetys to write another book?'),
(991, 96, 46, 4, 'I was surprised at how much I liked this book because I don\'t usually gravitate towards science fiction. It wasn\'t perfect, but I did overall really enjoy it! I was pleasantly surprised in the fact that for a male writer, Yancey writes in the female perspective very well--and he writes some pretty kick ass female characters, so if you appreciate that as much as I do, check this book out. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was the fact that a lot of the characters were so emotionally detached. None of the feelings seemed genuine, and the characters barely mourned at all over the deaths of their loved ones. It was mostly about action--a lot of times in an in your face and blunt way--not so much about feelings.'),

I loved getting to see a different perspective on Every Day, since it was one of the most thought-provoking books I\'ve ever read. While this book wasn\'t quite as perfect as the original (and I never expected it to be), Rhiannon\'s POV still proved to be insightful and was written with the same literary excellence. I will say that I was uncomfortable with the amount of infidelity in this book, because I don\'t believe that cheating on a partner is ever really justified. I think now more than ever, I really need the sequel to A\'s story.'),

Still, It didn\'t make reading it any easier. This book was definitely a tear jerker, but Clare has always been adamant on killing characters to add meaning and depth to the story. She\'s definitely not wrong, but it doesn\'t make it easier to read. Still, and amazing book (as always).'),
(994, 96, 54, 3, 'I wish Goodreads did half stars because this was definitely a 3.5 almost a four for me. \n I\'m about to rant a bit in this review because I feel like hate on this book for the wrong reasons. Here\'s the thing about this book, and about young adult books in general. This book was definitely intended for younger audiences on the young adult spectrum. The writing is very simple, and conflict gets resolved very quickly in the book. But that is not necessarily a bad thing, nor does it make this a bad book. Young adult is a very broad genre. You are going to have young adult writers that write with a wide vocabulary and include more graphic themes in their books, and you will also get books with more basic themes and simpler vocabulary, AND BOTH ARE EQUALLY NEEDED IN THE GENRE. Not all teenagers read at the same Lexile level, and that is a very important thing to understand. \n As for the story itself, I loved it. I thought it was very fun and super funny, I laughed out loud several times. The only problem I had with it was that the dialogue could be very unnatural and cringe-worthy at times. Overall I do think it was a good book, and even though I could see most of the plot coming, it didn\'t make me enjoy it any less. Zoe set out to create a positive message with diverse teens struggling with real life issues, and she got it exactly right. \n Was it a personal favorite of mine? Probably not, but I can also take a step back and realize that as a nineteen-year-old, I am not this book\'s target audience. This book is written for much younger readers going through these struggles and reading about characters like them for the first time, and as a publishing major, I can say that even though this book is not tailored to suit my preferences as a reader, it is a great asset to the young adult world and other readers.'),
(995, 96, 41, 5, 'Really excellent, I think this has been my favorite Shadowhunter Academy installment so far. It was very cute and brought in a lot of characters from The Mortal Instruments, which I always love to see. I think if you ship Malec you\'ll love this one'),
(996, 96, 51, 4, 'I have to say, I wasn\'t a huge fan of the first book in this series. It was ok, but I couldn\'t really get as into it as I wanted to.

That was how it was for me when I read the Legend series and I can tell that\'s how it\'s going to be for this series as well. I think my problem with The Young Elites was that I spent a majority of the book really confused and trying to take in everything about the world and reading this book, I had a better grip on all of that. \n The Rose Society is extremely dark--but that can only be expected since it is a villain origin story. I really found myself falling in love with the characters in this book and becoming way more attached to them. The first half of this book was kind of hard to get into for me but the second half completely made up for it--it was fantastic! I\'m so excited for the last book to come out and I have a feeling it\'s going to be my favorite out of the three, like how Champion ended up being my favorite Legend book. This is something really rare and unique about Lu\'s writing because it\'s usually the opposite for me. I always end up loving the first book in a series but it\'s really rare that I find a trilogy that I personally think has a satisfying ending.'),

The fact that One is written completely in free verse poetry adds power and emotion to the story and pulls the reader in.

I had no idea this book would have such an impact on me. I honestly was concerned I would even like it because the premise seemed like it might be a bit boring. This book was NOT boring. This book is beautifully written and original. The story is told with a mix of prose, poetry, drawings, IMs, and lists. I\'ve never read another book quite like this one. There were lines that completely blew me away and left me breathless upon finishing. I can\'t believe this is a debut novel. I almost finished this in one day because I couldn\'t put it down. The only thing I would change is that I desperately wish it was longer. The book is just barely 300 pages and it could easily be 100 more. I think it would have been interesting to have Madeline developed a bit more in the beginning before she meets Olly. Obviously she can\'t leave the house to meet friends but I just kept thinking there has to be an online community she could\'ve been a part, like a support group for other people with the disease.

In this time, there is a new medical procedure that has been invented which allows people to forget select memories that might be painful to them. The main character is originally intrigued by the procedure because he is coping with his dad\'s suicide and his own recent attempt at suicide. The story picks up Aarons life in the aftermath of this. I won\'t say much about the plot because I don\'t want to give too much away, but this books had a plot twist that really surprised me (which is something that is hard to achieve lately, since I read so much) and I couldn\'t put it down.

I\'m accounting it mostly to the fact that it just wasn\'t my cup of tea, but I thought that the prose was really boring, definitely not what I\'m used to from his other books. I will admit that I ended up skimming a lot of it because it was too hard for me to get into.

A has no gender, no sexual preference, A just is.

I was hesitant going into this book, and I honestly did not expect to like this as much as I did. \n About a year ago I was able to hear Katherine Howe speak at a YA literature festival, and it was clear that her books were very research based, and she clearly knew her stuff. I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to follow or get into the events in the book if they were written overly analytical, but that was not the case at all. This book managed to blend historical accounts with a great modern day voice that had me completely pulled in and immersed by the first chapter. \n \"Sometimes, Colleen, it can be hard to tell, in history. There\'s the dominant narrative. And there are the parts of the story that are overlooked. Maybe because they don\'t fit with what they people in charge have to say. Sometimes, the people in charge, all come to one explanation, and once that happens, they will do whatever they can cling to it. They\'ve staked their reputations on it being right. Maybe the experts have their own agenda. Maybe that\'s true for one group of people isn\'t necessarily true if looked at from another group\'s point of view.\" \n This novel has two alternate storylines. The main story follows Coleen, a high school senior starting her spring semester at a competitive private girls school that puts students on track for an ivy league education. One by one girls in the senior class begin to fall victim to a mysterious illness. Each girl has a different set of symptoms--symptoms very similar to the one\'s reported in Salem in 1706. Howe writes this story in a tone that feels as though someone is recounting events to you aloud. It is refreshing and completely immersive. Although I found some parts of the story obvious, I thoroughly enjoyed reading every part of it and was shocked by some twists I did not see coming. \n The story is interjected with interludes, where we follow Ann and the events that led to the Salem witch hunts. I found this narrative a bit confusing, and I blame that on my complete lack of knowledge on the Salem witch hunts and that part of history. Since it is told in first person, you don\'t get a lot of backstory on why things happen or the way that they happen. At first, I found this narrative boring and would skim to get back to the main story, but eventually this storyline gripped me as well. \n I\'m glad that I was able to put my original hesitations aside and give this book a chance, and it actually taught me a lot of interesting things about the Salem witch hunts. I had so much fun reading and trying to piece together the puzzle and figure out what was going on. It was definitely an original book unlike any YA I\'d read before, and that made it a very refreshing read.'),

I\'ve read plenty of books with multiple POV\'s before, and plenty of books that have flashbacks in time. What didn\'t work for me about this book was that it incorporated both. At the beginning, I felt like everything I read in Noah\'s story was pointless because I knew how everything had turned out from reading Jude\'s story. I definitely think that the flashbacks were an important part of the plot in this book, I just think that aligning them only with his character made his story seem pointless. I think I would have overall enjoyed the stories more if they were two separate books. \n Overall I thought the writing was really beautiful and it was so fascinating to read from the point of view of artists, and Jandy Nelson did a really good job writing that POV.

All Ethan wants to do is escape Gatlin and not end up stuck there in the predictable like everyone else. In walks Lena and everything changes. He\'s drawn to her, despite her black sheep reputation in town, but all she wants is for him to stay away. \n Overall I thought it was decent, but nothing about the premise or the story pulled me in.

To me, this book was really similar to We Were Liars, so maybe that was why I could guess the ending so easily. \n Aside from the disappointing conclusion to the mystery of the book, I didn\'t really like any of the characters at all. Dara and Nick both annoyed me equally and that made it even harder to like the book. But I will say that I love Lauren Oliver\'s writing style, so that was a redeeming quality for me, because I felt like it was really beautifully written, and I was very curious about how things were going to end, which led me to read the book very quickly. Things were just disappointing when I got there.'),

I appreciate Oliver\'s writing now more so than I did before, and I think that the whole concept of this series is absolutely beautiful. This was a great second book. I don\'t even mind the fact that there is a love triangle because it only seems fitting for a book about love and how it can hurt you, but is ultimately worth the pain. This is one of the best dystopian series around and I would highly recommend it!'),

This was Rowell\'s first time writing fantasy and she did not disappoint! I think because it isn\'t her usual genre of choice, she brought a really different style to the book. One thing I particularly loved was her magical world building. It was a really creative premise. \n I usually tend not to enjoy stand alone fantasy type books as much as I do series because you don\'t get as much character development and it usually feels rushed to me, but that wasn\'t the case at all with this book. In fact, it is probably my favorite stand alone fantasy to date. It is packed with TONS of character development and everything about the characters world was well explained and not confusing or rushed at all. It is a larger book and the beginning is a little slower because it gives you a lot of context, but it is definitely worth it. \n I noticed that most of the negative reviews of this book were centered around the fact that this book was similar to or copying Harry Potter. It was similar to Harry Potter in a lot of ways, but this did not bother me. For one thing, at the end of the book Rowell writes in her author\'s note that Carry On is HER take on the typical \"Chosen One\" type story. So naturally, a story about the \"chosen one\" would have similarities to Harry Potter, because that\'s what Harry Potter is. Personally, I liked the similarities to Harry Potter, because I liked how it was kind of the same but ultimately different, if that makes any sense. I love the Harry Potter stories, so of course I would like things that are similar, but this book stands out and is special in its own right.'),

Now it\'s time to Netflix the TV series, although I think it\'s going to be really different from the books!'),

I knew going into this book that it would be good-- you don\'t get an imprint named after your book if it\'s not good-- and I definitely was not disappointed. \n Speak tells the story of an incoming Freshman starting high school as an outsider. Having busted a party during the summer, all of her old friend, and pretty much everyone else in school, hate her. Speak features a very clique orientated and exclusive high school, and even though my high school experience was nothing like Melinda\'s, Anderson writes with such a beautiful and honest prose that it is so easy to relate to the story and relate to the feeling of being an outsider. \n One of the things I enjoyed most about this story was Anderson\'s character development. Every character in the story felt real, all like people you\'ve met before. A common mistake that authors make when writing shy characters is unintentionally writing them without a personality. Melinda is quiet-- but she still has a voice, and I enjoyed her as a character. \n Speak is a book that definitely lives up to its representation-- in the best way possible.'),

This book doesn\'t have a lot of hype but if you like the modern day superhero origin story I think this book is really great. The super powers in this book are really unique and it was fascinating to learn how each different one worked--that was definitely my favorite aspect of the book. I thought this book was original and it took me by suprise a couple of times. One thing I will say about the audio book is that I wish they would have cast different voice actors for each point of view, but the person reading did a pretty good job of doing different voices. I might continue on with the series but I\'m not sure. I enjoyed reading this but it ended nicely for me and I don\'t feel that pressured to pick up the next one any time soon.'),

What if you were just a random student at Hogwarts, trying to pass your OWLs while watching Harry, Ron, and Hermoine running around doing whatever it is they do? \n This book is extremely well written. It\'s told in first person, and the tone is really authentic and relatable. The other thing I really liked about this book was that it was just so different. It covered issues like mental disability, sexuality, and race and worked them naturally into the story in a way that I have never seen done before. I feel like the majority of young adult fiction should be headed in this direction. \n What I thought made the book really cool was that at the beginning of each chapter you got a little blurb about what the chosen kids were doing, which followed all the tropes a story like that normally would. But the story wasn\'t boring. If anything, it showed that everyone is the protagonist in their own life, and even if you don\'t feel special, or you\'re not the chosen one, you still have a story worth telling. \n The one thing that really made the story for me was that the plot stayed true to itself throughout the entire story. I liked the idea of telling a story through the innocent average bystanders eyes, and I was worried for awhile that the main character was suddenly going to become the hero, but the story didn\'t need that. You were rooting for the main character to fix his own problems, and sometimes ordinary is enough.'),

I have a love-hate relationship with the main character. Sometimes I admire her and think the book has good feminist values, and other times she comes across as very fake to me. I think the plot is the part that sucks you in. The blurb on the back of my books says \"A cross between The Hunger Games (minus the bloodsport) and The Bachelor (minus the bloodsport).\"(Publishers Weekly) Which I think is hilarious and accurate! It does have a love triangle which at first I was really annoyed by but now it doesn\'t bother me as much. I do think overall I enjoy the series.'),
(1020, 97, 26, 4, 'I was pleasantly surprised with this book! It didn\'t pan out at all the way I thought it would, and is pretty different from a lot of books I\'ve read recently. It doesn\'t really focus on romance at all, even though the female and male protag work together for a lot of the story, which I thought was refreshing. The book focuses a lot more on friendships and had more action and mystery than I was anticipating for a realistic fiction book. A super fun and easy read.'),

Anderson writes with a prose that is completely hypnotic and beautiful. It almost has the quality of free verse poetry. Everything about the book is real and raw and makes you feel like you are living the life of the main character. \n That being said, this book can definitely be triggering for anyone who has suffered from eating disorders in the past, because it is so honest and in your face. It is an important book and a story that needs to be told but be aware of the nature of the book before going in.

For one thing, the style of writing really bothered me (there was too much passive voice and it didn\'t suit the tense at all) and I disliked almost all of the characters. There were so many of them that you didn\'t really get close to any as an individual. I didn\'t really care what happened to the characters or the overall ending of the book, and was unclear on the whole concept of endgame to begin with. Even though they said the word Endgame almost 100 times, they never really clearly gave a description as to what it was.'),

The dialogue was as realistic as it was funny. Like, I loved every single one of them. The thing I love about Sarah Dessen books is that I feel like she does a really good job balancing the lighter humorous aspects and the heavy important issues.

Graves brings to life the remarkable awfulness of life within the Roman Empire, and demonstrates with alarming exactness how bad people can be, given motive and opportunity. The maxim that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is demonstrated here in spades. Paranoia and bloodlust within the few ruling families of ancient Italy are rampant, but the level-headed Claudius holds your faith that good might ultimately \"triumph\" (i.e., until the whole thing goes downhill again--why can\'t human society ever achieve sustained equilibrium?). I can understand now how Italy tolerated the buffoonish Prime Minister Berlusconi for so long. Compared with their Imperial past, his antics were a walk in the park.'),

And Ohio, my home state, is not far, or different, from Pennsylvania. Of course, he has to be soft-hearted in order to get away with some of the scenes he is witness to here.

I had always wondered about that tree. What was it about the knowledge of good and evil that could possibly be upsetting to God? The most plausible explanation I had been able to find was that humans put themselves on the same level as God, lording it over creation with their knowledge of good and evil. The author puts this story in its historical context and it becomes clear just what was (or rather, is, because as the book makes clear, it\'s still all very much with us today) going on here.

The pages are filled with insightful, quirky, dark humor.

There is the thought running through this and her other works that old school Christianity supplied something essential to the individual psyche and that modern American thought, in its unending search for \"true happiness\", has forgotten what it was, and has forgotten the unloved and forgotten souls along with it. And when you get right down to it, we are all, at one or more times in our lives, feeling forgotten or unloved. In O\'Connor\'s fiction, nothing is clear. People are deceptive or unknowing searchers and schemers, driven by forces of emotion or drama unknown and uncontrollable, but their thoughts and observations are simple.

There is no heaven or heroic rescue in these stories, only instance after instance of well-intentioned people finding reasons to do nothing, well-intentioned people mistakenly trusting villains, and villains running around deceiving adults again and again. There are also many instances of people following pop philosophies such as \"give people what they want\", \"a fair deal\" and \"rules must be followed\" to inflict the most pitiless and harmful abuse on innocent people, repeatedly. While these volumes were written between rise of the internet bubble (does anyone even remember that?) and the crash of Wall Street in 2008 (due to fake and dubious loans), which was punctuated by terrorism, torture and a war based on fear and fakery, the trend toward fear and fakery has only accelerated since then, and these stories continue to be quite timely. \n Here are some quotes from the Carnivorous Carnival: \n \"The story of the Baudelaires does not take place in a fictional land where lollipops grow on trees and singing mice do all of the chores. The story of the Baudelaires takes place in a very real world, where some people are laughed at just because they have something wrong with them, and where children can find themselves all alone in the world, struggling to understand the sinister mystery that surrounds them, and in this real world the arrival of lions means that the story is about to get much worse ...\" \n The carnival \"freaks\" are then recruited by Esme Squalor, \"the sixth most important financial advisor to the city,\" to throw not one of the carnival \"freaks\" but the fortune-teller, Madame Lulu, to the lions. \n \"Don\'t think of it as murder,\" Esme said. \"Think of it as a dramatic exercise. It\'s a special surprise for Count Olaf that will prove to him that you\'re brave enough to join his troupe.\" \n \"Throwing Lulu into a pit of lions doesn\'t strike me as particularly brave,\" Colette said. \"Just cruel and vicious.\" \n \"How can it be cruel and vicious to give people what they want?\" Esme asked. \"You want to joint Count Olaf\'s troupe, the crowd wants to see someone eaten by lions, and I want Madame Lulu thrown into the pit. Tomorrow, one of you will have the exciting opportunity to give everybody exactly what they want.\" ... \"When you put it like that,\" Hugo said thoughtfully, \"it doesn\'t sound so bad.\" \n And when the Bauldelaire orphans wake up the day of the \"show\", they meet a large crowd of carnival visitors who are excitedly looking forward to the throwing of some \"freak\" into the lion pit.'),

He does not even manage to figure out what is going on with the murdered woman\'s father, who seems to be all over the map, from boldly traveling halfway around the world and camping out in Tokyo to get the police to solve the case, to, for example, running up a hug bar tab while frequenting the hostess bars of Roppongi himself.

At first, it was good, denser than most novels, so I felt as if I had covered more than twenty pages of content when I was only on page nine. Nevertheless, I strained for something to happen, for the plot to thicken, so to speak--for the soup of this novel to boil into a rich, textured story of shock and morality. Instead, when all the steam had boiled away there was nothing left. The writing contained some sharp observations about time and memory, yes, and these built up expectations of some awful revelation. But the revelation never comes. The stone is slowly rolled away, and low and behold, the body is still there. \n But there seems to be more here than meets the eye. What really happened is subject to debate and reading of clues. \n Even the narrator may not fully understand even at the end. It leaves the reader wondering--not questioning her own views of things, but just wondering what happened in the story. \n And I don\'t think that is a good result for a story. Even if the narrator does not get it, the readers should, and on whether they do I give you the lively debate on Goodreads as Exhibit A. \n PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT: \n I felt that the apparent acts of Adrian were completely out of character. If he is so bold, then why do it? Why not face reality like a man? He strikes me as the gutless character in a Chekov tale rather than the bold youth he is built up to be. And why is Veronica angry with the narrator? Because of some unkind letter written 40 years ago? I don\'t understand what the narrator has to feel guilty about here. He had nothing to do with the actions of Adrian. Which makes Veronica seem nutso when yelling at him, \"You just don\'t get it do you?\" No. I don\'t.'),

He was a doctor in the army, a sort of pre-Cold War M.A.S.H. doc who ends up in command of his men in a Jap death camp, working for the good of the men, and dreaming of ... well, I won\'t spoil it. The crazy Japs do some crazy Jap things that are completely unbelievable for someone who knows Japanese culture. (Toast to Empire ... with tea? I don\'t think so.) For someone who has trained on Hemingway and/or McCarthy, it\'s an easy, familiar read.'),
(1058, 100, 75, 4, 'Sad yet heart-warming all at once--well written and an easy read \n An extremely well told tale, with an historic background that brings on the melancholy. Bad people are everywhere, sometimes right in front of you--but the most painful scenes are lightly told. The writing is very smooth and somewhat formulaic, so it is possible to skip ahead to the dialogue and not miss any story point. This enabled me to power through in 15 minute subway ride segments over the course of about ten days.'),
(1059, 100, 94, 3, 'Many of these stories are effused with the lingering emotional aftermath of the unspoken war just ended. An ineffable sense of mourning plays through the words and actions of broken or confused ex-soldiers interacting with untouched civilians. Other stories carry a long melancholic nostalgia for childhood innocence, or a just a nostalgic melancholy, with small jokes and odd details to lighten the mood, a contrast of adult versus child, a crushed innocence. \n I very much liked the fact that the book cover is exactly the same design as the one that sat on my father\'s shelf when I was a boy, thus invoking in me my own melancholic nostalgia.'),
(1060, 100, 81, 3, 'I was going to write about this novel simply as an interesting exploration of the psychological effects of racism. But it is much more than that. It is a fine first novel, and in the tender year of 1970, it would have been (was?) ground breaking. Now, of course, the heavy burden of social perceptions of beauty, the racist source of intra-racial hatred, and self-loathing triggered by poverty are well known--or are they? \n (Yet another famous writer from the Midwest--and Ohio no less. Three cheers for the Buckeye state.)'),
(1061, 100, 30, 4, 'Coupled with Flannery O\'Connor\'s \'all the stories\' collection, I was touring life in 1950s America. It was a bigoted, closeted, pleasant time, when people dressed well, read hard boiled pulp and didn\'t stick their noses in other people\'s business. I enjoyed greatly the description of all the little jobs that have irretrievably faded into history; the elevator operators, the western union offices, the man who has a job at a local bank in the next town, and having that job, makes enough to own a home in a nice neighborhood and raise a family. Where did these jobs go? Milton Friedman and his classical economist ilk sent them all away, across the borders and the oceans, because it\'s cheaper for the consumers, you know, those other people who have the good jobs, not the ones who are going to lose theirs when we throw their jobs onto the slag heap of there must be a better way. ... And I find that I have become a raving old coot.'),
(1062, 100, 80, 2, 'A quirky little (i.e., quickly read) novel, a sort of Twilight Zone of a situation, in which you can predict the direction fairly clearly, but it is creepy nonetheless. The direction of the story is much like The Lottery, a sort of community of oppression, but also fairly worn. The cousin, the interloper, is a practical business type, who can\'t stand quirkiness, who will not stand for oddity, and his appearance spells trouble. You sort of end up rooting for the person who seems like the source of the problem, but who is also somehow strangely innocent, as against the practical outsider, the snake who enters the garden and ruins everything.'),
(1063, 101, 80, 4, 'If the writing were not so very good I may not have been able to make it through. The plot reads at moments like a paranoid B-movie thriller, over-the-top conspiracy and chase, but unlike shlock writing, the main characters are well developed and their motivations understandable, the dialogue and scenes written by a thinker, possibly an artist, and certainly not a hack. The story mixes enough reality into the less plausible to make the whole thing hold together, and the plot chugs the story along. \n **** THERE BE SPOILERS **** \n There is a decidedly Christian theme running through the book, with a brotherhood of good people, knowing what the right thing to do is, fighting back in a volunteer army against the bacterial creep of the corporate/government overlords. The assignment of numbers to these people by a machine or perhaps a plant was spooky--sort of Arthur C. Clarke meets J. Edgar Hoover. I suppose the numbers could represent merely the uniqueness of each individual, ala, the hairs on your head are numbered, etc. But let\'s hope the movie (assuming Hollywood has not had enough of IT doomsday stories) decides to drop this device, because the disturbingly prescient power of the plant-people, combined with the number-of-the-beast creepiness kept me expecting the author to spring a turning-the-tables gottcha on the reader at any moment.'),
(1064, 101, 73, 3, 'An amusing, entertaining book about one man\'s experience of failed middle class life, featuring a lot of weeping and epiphany on the part of the main character, and plenty of plot twists to keep it interesting. A nice summer or long train ride read (do you not ride trains where you live? You have my sympathy). The failure of the middle class life here is really about the failure of the U.S. economic system to maintain enough jobs to allow the dwindling American middle class to prosper, which it fails to notice when things seem good; the author gets in some licks on that account--a thoroughly enjoyable smack down of a few individuals symbolizing the group think, self-satisfaction, and collective delusion that started in the eighties, built up critical mass in the nineties, and after 2007 brought down the cloudburst of shit rain.'),
(1065, 101, 41, 3, 'Science is hard, but reading this book is easy. Elizabeth Kolbert pens another thoughtful volume, this time explaining how the death of other species is a warning for our own. Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for us, too. Can we think our way out of this pickle? One can only hope, because dramatically changing our lifestyle seems to be completely off the table. Hell, we can barely get the oldies to switch to energy saving lightbulbs and low flow toilets without screaming about communistic fascism.'),

(1067, 101, 45, 2, 'This was a tough read. Not tough because of long meandering sentences ala Henry James, but tough because of long descriptive passages that elicit nearly no interest in this reader. I assume that at the time of its publication this book was valued for its vicious criticism of the hypocrisy of various (fictional) members of the British communists and somewhat less pointed criticism of British capitalists, and men (and women) in general. There are also criticisms of Cold War militarism and racist colonialism. All of these are more dated than informative. Somewhat like reading a LIFE magazine from 1944--it does not give you any new information, but it is useful as a window onto the popular outlooks of the time. For the most part, reading this book was like reading diary entries by an unhappy writer who complains about the persons she interacts with in a prose that is barely leavened with any kind of wit or linguistic pyrotechnics, and which is fairly banal, though meticulous, in its observations. I did greatly enjoy, however, the description of the fictional author\'s interactions with the British movie and television producers and the American theater producer. Her send up of these folks\' trivial understanding of her fictional work was very funny and insightful. I also enjoyed the pastiche of newspaper headlines from the ramping up on the Cold War in the 1950s, it being particularly painful to read here at the far end of that paranoid era, when we live with different newer (older) paranoia but are still living with the Cold War fears as well.'),
(1068, 101, 15, 4, 'I remember the moment in 1988 when my beloved aunt mentioned the book to me, saying it had a lot to think about. Now, thousands of miles and decades away, reading this feels like an anthropological dig, but the book is worth the read because of the excellent writing and the plausible plot. The way the government is overthrownaken is disturbingly realistic, a sort of Jade Helms led by Jesse Helms and Pat Robertson, the handmaid ends up living with Jimmy Swaggart and Tammy Faye Bakker, and the executions are tribal rituals. Hallelujah.'),
(1069, 101, 72, 4, 'Don\'t be fooled by the cover art, this is not \"about\" music; the story does not involve hanging out with musicians on tour or anything of that sort. This is about the unspoken love between siblings, lovers, husbands and wives, and parents and their children, set in the confusion of the 70s through the threat of the near future. It is about the sadness of the passage of time and things unsaid and human weakness. It is about how a small group of Americans experienced what life was like here/there. It is a wonderful story, very beautifully written and also surprisingly funny. Jennifer Egan has taken Brave New World and changed the ending and all of its characters because even though we substantially live in Huxley\'s imagined future we have somehow, mostly, managed to retain our humanity. \n ****SPOILER ALERT**** \n Here is one of my favorite passages (not a funny part): \n \"I felt no shame whatsoever in these activities [park janitor], because I understood what almost no one else seemed to grasp: that there was only an infinitesimal difference, a difference so small that it barely existed except as a figment of the human imagination, between working in a tall green glass building on Park Avenue and collecting litter in a park. If fact, there may have been no difference at all.\" \n This little paragraph, occurring by surprise, over 100 pages in, is pure Tao, pure New Testament ethics, pure truth. Reading it, I got the same feeling I got reading about the sword of heaven at the end of Chang Tzu. There are more of these little surprises scattered throughout the book. There is another surprise in this book, and that is the Powerpoint presentation. When I first got the book, I flipped through it and came across this Powerpoint thing and thought, oh, well, that\'s ... different. But then I read the book in the order designed and got to the Powerpoint and it worked brilliantly. Hats off to Ms. Egan.'),
(1070, 101, 58, 4, 'The Spielberg film, which cut out material that was \"extraneous\" to the central, ultimately uplifting story, I liked in a simplistic way. The book is more complicated, more painful and more fruity. The story of what European economic exploitation does to African farmers is reminiscent of what happened to the Native Americans, and what India, with the sometime blessing of the World Bank, did to its own indigenous farmers (see, e.g., essays by Arundhati Roy), and has been repeated everywhere, as far back as the industrial revolution (see, The Industrial Revolution in England by Paul Mantoux, and The Great Transformation by Karl Polanyi). Viz.: The new economic world is coming and if you don\'t play by its rules you are well and thoroughly screwed. So, Midwesterners, if you are in the way of fracking, beware. \n But back to this novel: the men here start out bad, yet, perhaps due to Walker\'s sunny outlook, most end up turning good. What I found most fruity was the ... pants. The pants and the astonishing ability of all the women to right their situations, of their men to see the light, and of the long lost to be ... well, you can sort of see it coming. What starts out as a lacerating commentary on post-slavery American society near the end has almost morphed into a sort of new-age entrepreneurial you-go-girl sort of TED talk. Perhaps knowing in advance the ultimate ending ruined it for me.'),
(1071, 101, 4, 5, 'Outstanding \n Roy has a facility for language that at times reminded me of James Joyce--alliterative and original. The scenes are colorful, poetic and fascinating. The points of view and the eye of the narrator is that of an artistic film director, watching the details of the objects and sounds in scene yet not losing sight of the principle action.'),
(1072, 101, 15, 4, 'From this collection I read the Utopia novelette, \"Herland\", and the eponymous Yellow Wallpaper. Herland is a strong entry into the Lennon \"Imagine\" category of wishful thinking ... asking us to think about what it would be like if everyone could get control of their pride and look at things differently. It is the \"everyone\" that is always the problem, because, as the writer points out, at least one third of the population (i.e., \"Terry\") is always never going to get there. When the Utopia is in fact a Distopia, such as imagined by Huxley, Orwell, or Ayn Rand, having that one third backstop usually helps prevent disaster, but only in fiction, not in reality--see, e.g., Hitler\'s dystopia and Nazi Germany. Herland does set out a good critique of society, and has some punchy, biting scenes where the women from Herland ask some pointed questions about male-female society that the men from America cannot adequately answer. \n The Yellow Wallpaper shows off Perkins\' perceptive and expressive powers. I have never read a better description of unsteady sanity--though if you would like to see the real thing, you can of course tune in to The Blaze.'),

(1074, 101, 46, 2, 'After getting pushed down on my \"to read\" list for many years, I finally picked up a Vonnegut. It read very easily, more like a magazine article than a novel, perhaps a novelette. \n This is a good novel to read after reading Rhodes\' \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb,\" as this is essentially the fiction companion to that. It\'s not about making the bomb, though, it\'s about scientists and their relationship with the rest of us, with some jabs at jingoism along the way. \n The author\'s hatred of women was distasteful, but then he doesn\'t seem to like men that much either. Perhaps one cannot blame this attitude on someone who witnessed the aftermath of the bombing of Dresden firsthand. Certainly Ambrose Bierce, another war spawned hater of man, deserves a pass. Primo Levi, though, is the better writer. \n While the fake religion of Bokononism is grating, it\'s also light and playful. In general this was an enjoyable read, although, as stated, the misogynist viewpoint doesn\'t age well.');
