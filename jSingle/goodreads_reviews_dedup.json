Best science fiction I've read in some time. I just loved all the descriptions of the society of the future - how they lived in trees, the notion of owning property or even getting married was gone. How every surface was a screen. \n The undulations of how society responds to the Trisolaran threat seem surprising to me. Maybe its more the Chinese perspective, but I wouldn't have thought the ETO would exist in book 1, and I wouldn't have thought people would get so over-confident in our primitive fleet's chances given you have to think that with superior science they would have weapons - and defenses - that would just be as rifles to arrows once were. \n But the moment when Luo Ji won as a wallfacer was just too cool. I may have actually done a fist pump. Though by the way, if the Dark Forest theory is right - and I see no reason why it wouldn't be - we as a society should probably stop broadcasting so much signal out into the universe.", "date_added": "Fri Aug 25 13:55:02 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Mon Oct 09 08:55:59 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 16, "n_comments": 0}
